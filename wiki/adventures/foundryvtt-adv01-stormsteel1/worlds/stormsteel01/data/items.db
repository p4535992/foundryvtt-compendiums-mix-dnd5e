It does however serve another, equally useful purpose—that of a rainwater tank.

These gather at the jug's bottom before being drawn through its soft substrate, crushed and treated until they form into a fine pearl worth 5 GP, and birthed out of the bottom of it. The leaves on the bottom of Riverreed Ewer curl inwards as the pearl begins to emerge—cupping it softly—and can be peeled back to release it afterwards.

The substance appears to be a fine green powder, and has two peculiar properties. The first is that it acts like an acid to any organic substance. If it comes into contact with flesh or plant matter it slowly dissolves, dealing 3 (1d4+1) acid damage per round for 2 minutes per ounce contacting the organic substance, and leaving an acrid smell in the air. The second property is that it can be burned for an extended period.

The spore then begins to grow, causing irritation, pain, and finally death once the fungus has reached a sizable mass. Once the host creature has perished, the fungus increases growth rapidly until it pushes a hollow tendril forth from the flesh. At the exposed end of the tendril the fungus begins growing a thin membrane, which is inflated by the gasses produced by the rotting body. When the membrane ruptures and disperses the spores, every breathing creature within a 40-foot radius sphere must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or inhale spores. If they fail, each hour afterward, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a -1 cumulative penalty to the roll. Each hour the creature suffers a cumulative 1d6 piercing damage (2d6 on the second failure, 3d6 on the third, etc.) as the fungus spreads throughout the internal organs. A single success stops the process and renders the fungus inert. If the fungus catches fire the spore sack soon explodes, and everyone within a 20-foot radius sphere suffers 3d6 fire damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, DC 15, or half as much on a successful save.

It can be identified by its vivid green leaves. These leaves when chewed produce large amounts of oxygen from the carbon dioxide already in the persons breath. One leaf may be chewed for up to ten minutes, before its properties are exhausted. The leaves are often boiled down to an essential oil, and the resultant infusion added to starchy natural substances to produce a gum. A piece of this gum will allow the recipient to survive without oxygen for 2d4 x 10 minutes, provided they are conscious and able to chew. The herbs main use is in allowing the recipient to survive in oxygen poor or free environments such as underground. When a tree is found it will normally have 5d10 leaves. Taking too many leaves can harm the tree. The tree has a chance of dying equal to the percentage of the leaves taken. For example, if 30% of the leaves are taken the tree has a 30% chance of dying, if 50% are taken it has a 50% chance of dying.

The leaves of the tree are small, waxy and dark, and spend the day curled tightly, only to open at night. During colder months the tree sprouts small purple flowers that blossom at night. Legend says that the trees first erupted from the ground during a fight between an avatar of Shar, and an avatar of Selune. During the fight the avatar of Shar was wounded, and where her drops of her blood fell upon several saplings, they were forever changed. It has been noted that the trees were once found more commonly in places where the Shadow Weave was most prominent. The wood is soft and flexible when first cut, but hardens over the course of several days, allowing craftsmen to work easily on freshly cut wood to easily create ornate pieces. Once hardened, the wood retains the shape it was crafted into. The wood is often used to create furniture such as elaborately carved chairs, tables, and desks. Additionally, the wood is used to crat intricately detailed scepters, wands, and staves, and a wooden weapon made of Twilight Birch is said to do extra damage to celestials (+3 force damage to successful against celestials). In addition, when a magical item is crafted using Twilight Birch, and used to cast a Death or Trickery Domain spell (even if used by non-Clerics), it allows the spell to be cast one level higher without using a higher-level spell slot. This ability can be used once per long rest, and only at night.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

In addition, the reduction of the wood over a low flame will cause a collection of sap on the ends of the wood. This sap can then be collected, further distilled, and consumed as a tincture that induces mild hallucinogenic effects, including the capability to see one’s own body from a third person point of view. It is argued among enthusiasts about whether you truly do see yourself in third person or whether the hallucinations are just a reconstruction of your surroundings using artificially heightened senses. There are no known negative side effects to pondstone sap consumption, and the recreational use of pondstone sap is referred to as Sap Goggling.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

A shallow and spreading root system robs nearby plants of food and moisture causing these trees to be found with few neighbors, even in areas of otherwise dense vegetation. The branches, if broken, ooze a translucent purple, viscous fluid that smells vaguely of citrus. The wax burns cleanly and evenly making it a good alternative to beeswax, and alchemists often seek it out as a foundation for magical glues and thickeners. Exceptionally skilled alchemists are able to use this wax to create a putty that can *permanently* change the shape and structure of facial features. The would-be master of disguise should be cautious however as minor, even accidental, tweaks to this formula will create a putty that causes organic matter (like faces) to dissolve and melt away in a matter of seconds.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Tiny blue and white flowers develop on the tips of its branches, blooming year-round. If a Spiderbush does not receive sunlight for a 24-hour period it will use its root system to waddle or shuffle across the ground in search of light. Having stubby, makeshift legs when combined with frequently uneven jungle ground, Spiderbushes tend to lose their balance and tumble through the jungle. Due to their ambulatory nature and need for direct sunlight, Spiderbushes naturally cluster together in clearings or along the tree line near the shore of an island. Periods of extended rainfall have been known to trigger sizable migrations of hundreds, even thousands of Spiderbushes shuffling and tumbling through the jungle in search of the sun.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The brand is curvaceous, with a single sheet of pressed, folded metal forming its entire length, all the way from its razor-sharp tip down to the bottom of its equally-keen guard. Despite its curvy shape, it isn't entirely rounded and numerous jagged notches and protrusions spring forth from it in places to ensnare unsuspecting victims. Interestingly, the purple illumination that emanates from the join between the blade's handle and guard hums quietly as if powered by some unseen power source.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sissoro was never intended to be a mere longsword. In truth, the blade forms one half of a pair of large, ornate scissors—the weapon of choice for a very powerful witch who ruled over a large and trackless swamp.

Once the weed reaches maturity, it produces a small cluster of white flowers. The petals of the flowers are coated with a dusty powder that causes a slight rash if it comes into contact with the skin. These petals are sometimes picked to create Itching Powder (When coming into contact with bare flesh, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw, DC 13, or begin itching for the next 2d4 hours, or until the powder is washed off.). The rapidly growing weed is said to overcome crops nearly overnight, choking out carefully planted fields, and destroying months of work.

Harvesting the fruit, drying them in the sun, and then soaking the dried fruit in the blood of a Lamia (those poor, misunderstood creatures) will create a sticky, scarlet paste called Blood Fire.

Results of 2-19 correspond to the 18 skills available to creatures respectively, while results of 1 and 20 are handled separately. The first time the creature who received the reading attempts an ability check using the skill that matches with the result, a D6 should be rolled and added to their check. The player attempting the check does so if the reading was for a player character, while the game master does it if it was for a non-player character. If the result of the check was a 1, the creature instead subtracts 1d6 from the next ability check they make using a skill that they're proficient in. While, if it was a 20, they instead add 1d6 to the next ability check they make using a skill that they're proficient in.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Seer</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">As a creature stares deeply into the misty haze that fills the Scryer's Orbuculum, the fog parts and the crystal ball fills with visions of the future.

Its first, and less noteworthy, component is a leather pauldron designed to sit comfortably over its wearer’s shoulder or armor and fasten securely in place. Affixed to this hide epaulette is an oddly-lifelike statuette of a stone gargoyle with turquoise gems for eyes. At a paltry eight inches tall while hunched, the tiny sculpture appears to be screeching, though is otherwise lifeless.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Guardgoyle is quite literally a guardian angel, albeit an unusual one.

Only the object's leather pauldron is visible until you attune to it. A small stone gargoyle appears perched on it the morning after you attune to it. Should you ever cease to be attuned to Guardgoyle, the gargoyle disappears once more. The gargoyle can also be destroyed as per Lifelife (below), in which case it must be restored through other means as described in that feature or be attuned to by a new creature that hasn't attuned to it</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"> before.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lifeline</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Guardgoyle does not squat idly by as its ward bleeds out beside it. When you are knocked unconscious as a result of being reduced to 0 hit points, it comes to life, takes flight, and attempts to protect you from harm to the best of its ability. The Guardgoyle continues to fight and defend you until you have stabilized and there are no longer any immediate threats to your wellbeing in your vicinity, at which time it returns to its position on your shoulder and reverts to being nothing more than an inanimate object of stone.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Rule Clarification, Guardgoyle.</strong> Statistical information necessary to use Guardgoyle in combat can be found in @Compendium[ddd-beginner-baubles.monsters.tiwrYBLZvKlmNf9i]{Guardgoyle}.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Settling Up</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Guardgoyle may be a useful and vigilant ally, but its loyalty comes with a price. Any time it is forced to animate and fight to defend you, you discover that you have lost an amount in GP equal to your level x 20 when you regain consciousness. This total can be in GP, other coinage, or objects of an equivalent value.

They are comfortable and easy to conceal due to two clever features of their design. Firstly, the claws are spring-loaded, neatly and safely folding into themselves as the creature wearing them </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">curls their fingers into a fist. Secondly, the blades protruding from either side are similarly designed to spring open, and lock into place with a satisfying click when not needed. Consequently, when a creature wearing these bagh nakh closes its fist completely, only a set of innocuous rings can be seen. Though bagh nakh have fallen out of favor of late, these insidious implements remain popular amongst assassins, political agents, and certain monastic orders; and are as quiet, efficient, and deadly as ever. Once belonging to a nameless killer-for-hire who was as notorious for his deeds as he was his anonymity, Final Sting has claimed kings and queens alike, and has proven to be a useful asset in any assassin's arsenal.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Weapon</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Final Sting can be used as a set of two bagh nakhs.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rule Clarification: Bagh Nakh.</strong> Rules for bagh nakhs can be found in @Compendium[ddd-beginner-baubles.rules.LeY4oabJ69pNyECb]{Items &amp; Equipment}.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>An Assassin's Tool</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Final Sting has been developed with a singular purpose in mind, to take life, and it accomplishes this task with startling efficacy.

Once either bagh nakh is placed onto your hand, you can close your fist and then uncurl your pinkie or index finger before gently tugging the ring from it. The ring comes away easily and as it does so the implement vanishes without a trace other than the two rings, which remain. It then reappears only if both rings are placed on their correct digits at the same time or the pair are touched together.

On a failed save take 6d8 poison damage and the poisoned effect for 6 hours, and on a successful save take half as much damage with no secondary effect.), leading to a bloody death in as little as 20 to 30 seconds.

It was once gold plated although the gold has chipped in places, and dulled in others. Perhaps most strikingly of all, the rail appears to be steadily emitting a thin wispy fog. This vapor disperses quickly if it is disturbed or while the rail is in motion, however any time it is still, the fog coalesces to form a thin film that looks just like the canvas curtain it has lost.

When you use the Phantasmal Rail to make an attack against a Medium or smaller creature and score a critical hit, a frightening spectral form bursts from the mist surrounding curtain rail.

If you are attuned to the Sundrop, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your AC is increased by 2.</li>\n<li>You look younger and are immune to the effects of aging. If you lose attunement to the Sundrop, your original age and looks return.</li>\n<li>You deal an additional [[/r 1d6]] <strong>radiant </strong>damage with all weapon attacks when the sun is up and not blocked by clouds.</li>\n<li>The Sundrop has 16 charges, and regains all expended charges at dawn.

These tassels are actually the fungi’s reproductive organs, and the spores from these structures can be harvested and mixed with oil to create an ingested poison called Pale Tincture. This milky liquid is the primary choice of cruel manipulators that often use it to coerce favors out of unwilling acquaintances. The poison is introduced unknowingly, and slowly chips away at the victim's vitality, always threatening a slow and painful death. The promise of a cure is enough to make most people do things that they would otherwise avoid. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw vs poison or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 8 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally, and only a greater restoration spell can end this poison outside of the cure or making the successful saving throws. The cure can be made by harvesting the toadstool’s spores and combining these with alcohol that is then exposed to at least 15 points of radiant damage, which is enough to mutate the poisonous compounds in the spores.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The wine is considered sacred to many practicing clerics (capable of restoring an expended spell slot for a cleric that consumes the wine) and the berries can be used with the spell Goodberry, and these berries will instead restore 2 hit points per berry and last for an additional day.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The fibrous roots of a Constrictor Vine resemble wet human hair, are incredibly strong, and retain much of this strength even after being harvested and dried. As the roots grow, they wrap themselves around rocks, root systems, and anything else in their path. When the roots reach ~30' to ~50' they begin to slowly, yet inexorably constrict back towards the core of the plant. This constriction has been known to topple whole trees and move many ton boulders.

On a result of 14-17, it is conversant and will offer up short, gruff answers to a handful of questions in dwarven. On a result of 18-21, it is friendly and will offer more thorough answers to a wider variety of questions in common.

The very next morning he was gone, but the crane he left behind seemed to be very much alive.\"</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Paper Folds</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This unassuming slip of paper is astoundingly versatile, as any who explore its seams and folds quickly discovers. As an action, you can fold Tamotuki to imitate the rudimentary shape and configuration of any Tiny object, though it is clearly only an origami replica and isn't mistaken for the genuine article without a much more elaborate ruse. The folded parchment is surprisingly strong and durable and can fulfil the same basic function as the object it is imitating, as long as that purpose is simple in nature. For example, Tamotuki cannot be used to manipulate a complicated lock's pins and tumblers while imitating a key, however it could be used as a doorstop. You can unfold it so that it returns to its flat form as an action. Tamotuki is waterproof and can be used in any of the following ways, though this list is by no means exhaustive:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as any basic piece of ammunition.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a dagger or sickle.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a cup, plate, bowl, or other tiny receptacle or container.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a paper plane or boat.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a key that opens any simple lock which can be unlocked with a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can also fold </span>Tamotuki <span class=\"fontstyle0\">to loosely resemble a creature of any size, though the imitation itself is Tiny. If you fold it in such a way, the paper becomes animated and acts as per the natural instincts of </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">the creature being imitated or your psychic wishes, as long as you remain within 120 feet of it. If you move further from it, it becomes inert and crumbles to floor in a crumpled up ball.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rule Clarification, Variant Origami Folds.</strong> When Tamotuki is folded into certain forms, it gains special features. You can find these in the Biography section of both of its statblocks (linked below).</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-style:italic\">Rule Clarification, Animated Origami Parchment.</strong><span style=\"font-style:italic\"> Statistical information necessary to use Tamotuki in combat can be found in @Compendium[ddd-beginner-baubles.monsters.wYuIuoMvEVtU76IV]{Animated Origami Parchment}.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Multiply (1/day)</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A single origami creation is little more than a novelty, though several hundred of them is another matter altogether. When Tamotuki is folded to resemble a creature, and thus animated, you can psychically instruct it to multiply as a bonus action. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until Tamotuki is reduced to 0 hit points.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong style=\"font-style:italic\">Rule Clarification, Animated Origami Swarm.</strong><span style=\"font-style:italic\"> Statistical information necessary to use Tamotuki as a swarm in combat can be found in @Compendium[ddd-beginner-baubles.monsters.4NalQBxJYaNXbFl5]{Animated Origami Swarm}.</span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Eastern Riches","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"GKct8oevKfiR8DZJ":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Aspens have long been considered a gift from the Fae, and so have developed quite a superstitious following. Crowns of green Aspen wood are commonly placed upon the heads of those to be buried in burial mounds, as is the tradition in some places, are though to ensure easy passage to the afterlife or a guarantee at being reborn into the next life more quickly. An Aspen leaf placed under the tongue while sleeping is thought to make the bearer more eloquent. And to some, Aspen has long been a treatment for fears and apprehensions when applied as oil extracts. Whether or not any of this is true is debatable, but some will put superstition before what the can see as proof.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The stalk is a blue-green color, and several pale leaves grow along the length. During nights of the full moon the plant buds a flower, which appears wispy and translucent. Attemping to touch the flower reveals that it is incorporeal, and has the substance of smoke. Come morning the flower disperses on the wind, sending the seeds of the flower on their path. The roots of the flower can be used to make an oil that allows blades to strike incorporeal creatures, called Ghostbane Oil. Using the roots of the Specterflower, alchemists are capable of distilling an oil, that when applied correctly, allows non-magical weapons to inflict full damage upon incorporeal creatures as if they were physical creatures.

Cachuga peppers are vaguely pyramidal shaped woody bushes with profuse foliage that bear clusters of small, fragrant yellow blooms which eventually give way to fiery peppers of a marbled red-orange. The bushes bloom continually in the tropical climes of the Swordfish Islands causing Cachuga bushes to produce large numbers of these firey peppers. The peppers themselves are 2-4 inches long and hang from the bushes by thick, green, vein-like structures. Cachuga Peppers are exceptionally spicy and flavorful, and the skin of these peppers is leathery and can be mashed into a paste, then shaped and dried into chips or a flavorful yet non-spicy paper-like wrapping, pairing nicely with raw fish. The peppers dry well, retaining their fire and flavor for exceptional periods of time, and their seeds can be ground into a powder that causes *severe* eye and skin irritation (DC 16 Cons.

When unsuspecting prey wanders nearby, the tendrils snake around flailing limbs, dragging it into the maw. The plant slowly submerges back beneath the surface, crushing the prey caught within its grasp. The Marsh Maw is a danger that dwells within shallow swamps, using the brackish water as camouflage. The plant has a deep root system that goes deep, holding the monstrosity in place. The Maw often lurks at the edges of the swamp, near where herd animals come to drink. More than a few unlucky shepherds have lost members of their flock to the danger that lurks just beneath the surface.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Armor Class: 14</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Hit Points: 112 (14d10+28)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Speed: 20 ft., swim 20 ft.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">STR: 16 DEX: 12 CON: 14 INT: 4 WIS: 10 CHA: 6</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Damage Resistances: Bludgeoning</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Damage Weaknesses: Necrotic</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Condition Immunities: Blinded, deafened, frightened, prone</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Noto Sans Symbols', sans-serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;margin-left:36pt\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Bookman Old Style', serif;font-variant-numeric:normal;font-variant-east-asian:normal;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Senses: blindsight 60 ft.

Though recognisable as a lectern, the object is choked by creeping vines, has glowing crystals erupting from its surface, and a set of feathery wings flank its slanted top. The pintsized rhetorician who manufactured it loved to wander, explore, and especially to bring knowledge to remote places. She believed, rather insistently, that wisdom and understanding shouldn't be locked away in musty old libraries, nor that anyone should miss out on such things simply because of where they lived. Consequently, her traveling lectern is perfect for scholars out in the field, far from the contemplative studies and rooms set aside for quiet reflection they might normally be accustomed to.</em></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Despite its strange visage, all of the basic amenities a speaker might need can be found on Listrum, so that its owner is fully equipped to read, write, and lecture in even the most inhospitable of conditions.

You can also perform the same trick in reverse to get the object to revert to its original size. While the object itself shrinks, a chain that hangs from its slanted top does not.

The detailing, most notably evident on the filigree that runs around the board's perimeter and in the carving of each piece, is exquisite and really needs to be seen up close to fully appreciate.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Gilded Chess Set was fashioned by the members of an adventuring party who, upon disbanding at the end of a long and storied career, each contributed something unique and precious to the project. Its dwarf lord smelted high carat gold, the elven ranger fetched wood from their homeland, human hands stitched the velvet, and the group's half-orc took it upon herself to hunt down and fell a mighty beast for the ivory required to finish the set.

Six to twelve stalks, each 8\" to 10\" high grow from the center of this cluster. A pair of hinged, shovel shaped, bright fuchsia leaves, rimmed in spikes sit at the top of each stalk. These stalks sway constantly, as if moved by a gentle breeze. It is unclear how exactly Snapping Grass hunts, but the moving stalks are able to bend, lunge and snap up small creatures with exceptional accuracy. While this plant subsists almost entirely on a diet of small vermin and birds, some adventurers have reported that some clumps of Snapping Grass will lunge and attempt to eat small, shiny or sparkling objects like rings and gems.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The roots were hacked at with swords and glaives and major limbs felled with large axes. All the while, the monk sat beneath the tree and still meditated. When the king’s servants had finished their destruction, the monk retrieved a bottle of sacramental wine from his bag and fed it to the tree’s damaged roots, vowing that if the tree should die, so would he. Upon the completion of this vow, the tree’s roots absorbed the wine and began to repair themselves at an incredibly rate, and the tree grew larger and lusher than it had been before.

Its exterior has lots of small buttons, dials, and switches on it, which are used to configure the device into its different modes of use. Many of these are completely unnecessary and aren't linked to any function whatsoever, as if its inventor intended on adding features to it that ultimately never saw inclusion. Though, to a creature not versed in spellcasting, even the buttons it has are perfectly redundant.\"</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Attunement Requirement</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In order to make use of the Ley Compass' features, you must be attuned to it and able to cast at least one spell. If you do not fulfil these requirements, you can still use it as a mundane, nonmagical compass. Any effects created by the Ley Compass are considered to be a form of Conjuration magic and can be detected through Truesight or the use of spells</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Magical Marker</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Using the Ley Compass, a creature can quickly and easily find their way back to a significant location. Pressing one of its buttons causes it to create an invisible, formless magical marker in its current location. Using its other controls, you can configure it to recognise a specific marker as due north. It can maintain five such markers at once, though any attempt to exceed this number causes all of its existing magical markers to fizzle away into nothingness.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Arcane Breadcrumbs</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A creature armed with the Ley Compass has certain advantages against becoming lost. By flicking a switch on it, you can set it to deposit discrete magical waypoints every 50 foot for 1 hour. You can then use it to locate the nearest marker in whichever direction it is facing. These markers degrade after 24 hours, vanishing entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Portal Insights</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Ley Compass is linked closely with portals and teleportation circles, affording its wielder certain insights into them. Should the device be brought within 50 foot of any kind of magical portal or gateway, its surface becomes tranquil and crystal clear. Creatures on the Ley Compass' side of the portal or gateway can then peer through it and see the area where it emerges.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, while within 50 foot of a magical gateway that re-emerges elsewhere on the same plane of existence the Ley Compass is on, you can touch your current location on a map if you have one, enter a trance-like state, and trace your finger to the place in the world where the gateway leads. If it doesn't emerge within the confines of the map, you're able to trace its trajectory until you reach the edge of the map instead.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Sagely Impedimenta","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"GKct8oevKfiR8DZJ":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The roots of a Dripping Tree spread and twist through the ground almost as far as the branches above. Numerous cream-colored spheres, 10\" in diameter, that cling to the branches are the source of the tree's name. Special nodules on the roots of this tree detect movement, warmth and pressure causing the globes directly above the triggered area to fall. The globes are filled with a viscous, sticky mucus and burst on contact, causing creatures hit with them to stick to the Dripping Tree's root clusters (DC 18 Dexterity or Strength Save to avoid grapple). When pressure is constantly applied to an area of roots, the branches above it begin to slowly drip a sticky, acidic, digestive mucus onto the area below (1d6 acid damage per hour). This mucus melts through flesh and bones like butter.

The mold moves slowly enough that even people sleeping in its path have no fear of being overwhelmed, although corpses that lay in the same place for days will be overcome. The Grammax also floats on water, often spreading across the surface of underground puddles and stagnant lakes, hiding the actual depths. The Grammax reacts rapidly to the presence of flame or high heat, quickly shrinking away while expelling any trapped gas.

When the weapon pierces its target, the poison will take effect killing the victim within 2d6 hours. There is no save and no cure, except for the antidote outlined below. Not even the most powerful magic can cure this poison. The only cure for this poison is also made from the Silverthorn plant.

The thin trunks of the trees are remarkably durable, despite high winds and heavy snowfall, and one use of the tree is the wood, which is often used by the Volodni craftsmen to create weapons and armor. Magically treating the wood, which is called “bluewood”, causes it to become as hard as steel, although only weighing half as much (crafting with bluewood requires special training from a masterwork craftsperson). High priced entertainers often burn small pieces of the wood, which creates leaping blue flames. The leaves and sap are often ground in the creation of a vivid blue dye that is used to dye clothes in the North, and often in the creation of inks for tattoos. One pirate fleet that has plagued the Sword Coast in recent years is notorious for their crews bearing frightening looking blue tattoos covering their faces.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

This is due in large part to its size and weight, although the fact that its face is covered in dozens of small spiked protrusions only serves to heighten its ferocious appearance, giving it more than a passing resemblance to a meat tenderizer. However, it is neither the fact that the object is a large maul nor its painful prongs that contribute most to its harrowing guise. That honor is reserved for the detailed, three-dimensional depiction of a troll that has been carved carefully into the maul's cheek. At times, this dour, scowling presence feels almost alive, as if seething with anger. This is most common as daylight starts to fail around dusk, causing the troll's features to cast a terrifying shadow as its silhouette stretches out and becomes monstrously long and deformed. The maul itself appears to be in a bad state of disrepair; its rock cracked and crumbling in places, paint fading, details weathered, and most of its surface buried under a thick layer of moss. However, as anyone who's wielded the item can attest, it still has life in it yet, and a thirst for troll blood.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Jötynnbaen was the pride and joy of a deranged, near-crazy dwarf lord who made it his life's work to hunt down every troll in the world and kill them<span style=\"font-size:14px\">—</span>a lofty, if a little unrealistic, goal. However, unlike others of his kind, who were content to simply denounce, oppose, and slay trolls, Jötynnbaen's former master was fascinated by them and their supernatural healing abilities.

Their shallow roots and sparse leaves require the tree to seek nutrition through being carnivorous. The main body of the trunk has a hollow tube containing a digestive acid. The ropy appendages drag trapped prey upward and drops them inside the opening. The opening is surrounded by a number of downward facing spines which make escape difficult. Due to the shallow roots, the trees may move at a glacial pace, allowing most prey to easily outrun them. However, the trees rely upon a perfume their leaves emit that causes hallucinations to lure potential victims closer. Upon an encounter, PC’s must make a DC 14 Wisdom Save or be lured in to the tree’s appendages. The character must then make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity save to avoid taking 8d6 acid damage.

This embouchure connects to a long, slender pipework tubing that is held upright and extends vertically up to a figurehead from which the note being played emanates. Due to the length of its cylinder, sounds produced by the carnyx are broadcast over the heads of those around it and can be heard out to great distances.

Should an elf wildshape into a spider it might cover their body and legs up to and including their coxa, trochanter, and femur. Whereas, it might instead cover the body, upper legs, and shoulders of a bear; or the entirety of a fish with just an opening for its tail and small slits for its gills.

The moss growing on piles of rubble or loose rock is the most dangerous as friction from shifting stones can create enough heat or sparks to ignite patches of the moss, turning what was once a moss-covered mound of debris into a raging inferno.

Creatures caught in the blast that can see and don't have their eyes covered must attempt a DC 8 Constitution saving throw. On a fail, they have disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. Undead creatures affected by this feature have disadvantage on their saving throw and those who fail it also take 1d4 radiant damage and are incapacitated for the duration.

You can undertake a ritual with the shield once per day that takes 1 hour to perform. During this ritual, the shield must be laid on the ground and cannot be moved or disturbed. For 24 hours after the ritual is complete, the ground in a 30 foot cube centered on where Empyrean was placed during the ritual fills with purple flowers and is considered consecrated ground. During this time, the ground becomes difficult terrain for undead creatures and they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws while in the affected area.

The umbrella's handle and shaft are formed of what looks like a wooden tree trunk, albeit one that is oddly thin and wiry. Meanwhile, its canopy depicts the underside of a cherry blossom tree on the inside and the top of one on the outside. Strangely, though these images are two-dimensional, they're incredibly detailed, authentic, and lifelike. A creature that studies their flat lines for more than a few seconds discovers hidden depths in their contours.

Also known as “bread of the desert”, this plant develops large spherical fruits nearly the size of a man’s head. These fruits have a tough and leathery exterior, but when cut open, the fruit has the consistency of fluffy bread or cake. The seeds of the fruit are quite small. Each fruit contains enough nutrients to sustain four people for a day. Unfortunately, farming the plant seems to be near impossible. The seeds must be within a medium-size creature when it dies, at which point the release of certain gasses causes the seeds to mature and greedily absorb as much moisture and nutrients from the corpse as possible.

The poison can be applied to any surface, adhering to it until it comes into contact with organic matter, which it quickly seeps into. It is clear, nearly invisible, and odorless, but can be easily identified by agitating the liquid in any way, which causes it to flash violently with varying hues of light. Due to its use in bringing down many nobles in past generations, it has been banned in nearly every established civilization. Being caught with it on your person is akin to an instant death sentence and one can only learn of its nature by asking the right person. Ask the wrong person, and you may find yourself put to death. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poisoned creature feels no immediate effect and is unaware of their condition. After a week, the creature gains an effect listed on the short-term madness table (DMG pg. 259). When the short-term effect ends, they gain an effect from the long-term madness table (DMG pg. 260). When the original long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term effect as well as an indefinite effect (DMG pg. 260). After each long-term effect ends, they gain a new long-term and indefinite madness effect until they die or are cured. This effect can only be cured by a greater restoration spell cast at 7th level or higher.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":4600000,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"_id":"p6cs2immn9s6du6m","name":"Hunting Trap","type":"consumable","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_14.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center.

If the wielder refuses or is unable to attack, they must succeed a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong>. On a failure, they are charmed by Foecleaver, which attacks the evil creature each turn, until the evil creature is slain or runs away, the wielder is incapacitated, or Foecleaver loses sight of the target.  Similarly, any evil character which attunes to this item must make a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong> or be permanently charmed by Foecleaver until the effect is removed. If the wielder takes any damage, they may repeat the <strong>saving throw</strong> against being charmed, ending the effect on a success and becoming immune to being charmed by Foecleaver for 24 hours.</p>\n<h6><strong>Credit: Gnoblin's Stuff</strong></h6>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Super's Pack","quantity":1,"weight":25,"price":null,"attunement":0,"equipped":true,"rarity":"artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":15,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":10,"max":"10","per":"charges","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"str","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"3","chatFlavor":"You want cleavage?

Ingesting the bourbon makes the user immune to its secondary properties, and so cheating brawlers may take a swig of the bourbon and spill some on their hands. The poison works as a contact toxin that will then weaken the opponent of a bare-knuckle brawl. The target must make a DC 14 Cons. Save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature is then also knocked unconscious for the same amount of time.

That said, the javelin does have other unique qualities besides just the materials used in its construction, and it is thanks to these that its true significance is assured. For, although its role in the history books might be oft overlooked, this implement has been used to prevent many tragedies and travesties over the years, and has the potential to avert many more in the future.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Weapon</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning can be used as a javelin.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Message Compartment</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning has a small receptacle built into its handle that is used for the purpose of storing letters, messages, and writs that have been rolled up.

Objects weighing up to 1 pound can be interned in this chamber.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Modes of Operation</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning has 4 operating modes, which are activated in the following ways:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Screamer Mode.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you twist its handle 90-degrees clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Screamer mode. If the javelin is thrown skyward while in this mode, something occurs at the apex of its arc. What happens depends on whether it is day or night. During the day, the javelin emits a high-pitched sonic boom that can be heard out to a radius of 600 foot. During the night, the javelin looses a blinding flash of light that is visible out to a radius of 1,800 foot instead. Afterwards, the javelin returns to its Default mode and cannot reenter Screamer mode for 24-hours.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Seeker Mode.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you twist its handle 90-degrees counter-clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Seeker mode. If the javelin is thrown into the air while in this mode, ethereal wings form around it during its flight and bare it away to a designated location within ten miles. In order for this mode to activate, you must have a suitable location in your mind’s eye at the moment you throw it.

It is an evergreen, which has prickly stiff foliage. The berries appear in early summer, but take roughly three years to ripen to the stage where they are useful. Unripe berries are green, ripe ones are bluish-black in colour. Because of this rather long period of ripening, it is wise to never denude a tree of berries. A normal sized tree will have between 100 and 200 ripe berries. 15 of these berries should be crushed and mixed with boiling water. When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours). This liquid will only keep for a month under normal conditions, but can be mixed with an alcoholic spirit to increase its lifespan indefinitely. According to the traditions of some northern nomads, a sprig of juniper kept in a house would protect the inhabitants from vampire attacks. This may actually work at the DM’s discretion.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

The fronds of a mature Witchweave are approximately 3' long before splitting into 7 to 10 pale green leaves with drooping, fibrous tips that grow for another 2' to 3'. It is the numerous white fibers, resembling hair, appearing in the splits of the leaf tips that give the Witchweave its name. These leaves are prized by the Lizardfolk natives of the Swordfish Islands who harvest, dry and process them into rope and rough cloth. The Witchweave blooms with small yellow flowers that give way to oblong, reddish fruit about the size of a human thumb. If the fruits are dried, wrapped in fresh green Witchweave leaves and burned, a thick, deep blue smoke with a sweet, musky odor is produced. This smoke acts as a potent anesthetic to exposed flesh, and the Lizardfolk are known to fill tents and lodges with it for both medical and spiritual reasons. It is rumored that some of the Lizardfolk's powerful shaman are able to refine the fruit of the Witchweave even further to create potent healing salves and unguents, but if true, these secrets are highly guarded.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

If the dragon is chromatic, its leather hilt changes to match their color; if the dragon is metallic, its blade changes to match the type of metal it is associated with. Its blade and hilt can both change simultaneously if there are both chromatic and metallic dragons within range. The polearm's features change to represent the type of the oldest and most powerful dragon (or dragons) within range. If there are multiple dragons of the same age and strength within range, the blade instead changes to mimic the type of the nearest dragon.

If a Hidden Hibiscus is threatened, or detects rapid movement nearby, any blooms on the bush immediately change their color to drab greens and browns, and the entire plant appears to wilt and wither. Skilled alchemists use the roots of the Hidden Hibiscus to amplify their creations that aid in natural camouflage (adding wilted hidden hibiscus to armor will negate any stealth penalties that the armor normally has), but the blooms of the hibiscus are its true prize as they can be used to dramatically increase both physical and mental speed for short periods of time (+2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence stats for 1d4+1 hours).

The tree itself is actually comprised of an extensive root system, from which a number of trunks sprout to the heavens. While the trunk and branches are extremely dark, the leaves of the tree are pale grey and white, often giving the branches an appearance of glowing in the moonlight. The trees are often harvested for their precious darkwood, which has the sturdiness of other hard woods, but is favored because it only weighs half as much. Darkwood weapons and shields are often very light and worked only by the most skilled of craftsmen (shields made of darkwood grant +2 AC and +1 to stealth checks made while holding the shield), both properties that cause such goods to be quite expensive. Wizards of the South favor darkwood when constructing rods, wands, and staves.

Conversely, he was applauded and highly sought-after for his ability to cut sharply between towering rocks, navigate crowded ports, and cleave through perilous storms at breakneck speeds.

To some, this might suggest a drow influence, indicating that the shoes were conceived of and manufactured deep below the earth. However, as those familiar with drow design sensibilities would know, such objects would be far more likely to depict arachnids, or remain plain and utilitarian, than incorporate such an overtly leafy motif.

Unlike normal grasses, Tickleweed prefers to grow on nearly vertical surfaces and will even thrive in dark places, assuming there is ample moisture. The cylindrical leaf-blades are highly sensitive to even the subtlest shifts in ambient temperature, so they move and shift continually. Tickleweed stretches towards increases in temperature and away from decreases. Each leaf moves independently causing the plants to appear to ripple and shiver with waves. Even the simple act of walking past a patch of Tickleweed will trigger a flurry of movement. Tickleweed bloom very rarely with circular flowers of red or white with a central black \"eye\".

Vines are about 5 mm thick, with 2 mm long thorns and are reddish brown, darkening to black, with leaves dark green in colour. The vines flower in early summer, with light blue, bell shaped flowers. In autumn, it carries dark blue or purple berries, which are fleshy, almost crunchy rather than juicy. The berries are slightly sweet and quite tasty, but have a strong effect on mammals: those who eat them fall asleep. The berries have this effect on mammals only (with half effects on half-mammals like half-elves and the like), but a single berry is enough to bring down any man sized or smaller mammal, and given enough berries, even the greatest mammal will fall asleep. There is no saving throw, although the sleep caused is quite normal, and a sleeping creature can simply be awakened. Although the berries can simply be eaten to cause the effect, it is also possible to dry them carefully and grind them into powder. This powder is weaker (DC 14 cons. save vs poison to avoid) but will keep for a much longer time. The powder can be added to any food or drink, but has a very sweet taste.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":"","autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"ownership":{"default":0,"0dke80Cb9LhbPTyn":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

A creature remains cursed in this way until targeted by a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell or divine intervention. Removing the crown fails to end the curse. While a cursed creature may not reveal that the diadem is cursed, its allies may be able to deduce its presence and effects based on the creature's behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Credit: the_griffons_saddlebag</h6>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Super's Pack","quantity":1,"weight":0.03,"price":69000,"attunement":0,"equipped":true,"rarity":"veryRare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":0,"type":"trinket","dex":0},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true},"ownership":{"default":0,"hDKSaQdd06dT2ews":3,"a2um1mRnicEx282I":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}
