Instead, it is designed for self-control and mental clarity. Some practitioners refuse to apply their discipline in a violent fashion, believing to do so would be a failure of their philosophy. For others, to commit this practice to violence is a&nbsp; logical progression. Some take this to an extreme, using it only to benefit themselves. Others are considered heroes, fighting for noble causes and refusing to stand idle while the innocent suffer. These adventurers love sparring and often duel aggressively with allies to test their mettle and skill. Though not a requirement for friendship, it goes a long way to match a grandmaster in combat. Even enemies matching their skills in a fair duel will garner respect.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">SYNERGY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">This archetype works best with the grounder, gunslinger, and martial artist classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">PROFICIENCIES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have proficiency with all simple melee weapons.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">MARTIAL ART DISCIPLINE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you can select a specific martial art discipline.
