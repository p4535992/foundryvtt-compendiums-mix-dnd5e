The bipedla blood relative of their ursine ancestors, bearkin live in small tribes or clas of about a dozen deep in forests, caves, and sometimes arctic wastelands where they are able to hunt and kill their prey with vicious ferocity.

They still carry the ferocity of the race however, despite their smaller size. Forming small nomadic communities in the trees in their notoriously hot and dangerous homeland, they drop from low-hanging branches to surprise and attack their prey which is often many times their size.

With no great empires or kingdoms to call home, the Mousefolk spend their lives carving a place for themselves in the cities of the larger races or in the untamed wilds. They form tight-knit communities where every member is expected to contribute to the success of the whole.

Following some transformative event in that time, or upon reaching 100 years old, the ordinary fox permanently transforms into a vulpine-featured Kitsune and gains consciousness equivalent to other humanoids.

Their vulpine ancestry makes most Kitsune tend towards chaotic alignments, and they are generally neutral in the conflict between good and evil. </li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Size:</span> Kitsune heights range widely, from the tallest Halfling to the shortest Elf.

They transform into wise, bipedal foxes, with thick red fur, thin snouts, and tufted ears, and gain the ability to shapeshift into a humanoid form for long periods of time. Their appearance when in humanoid form is similar to that of a Kitsune Tsuki, but they lack the social grace of the Tsuki, and are more easily discovered when they attempt to infiltrate a settlement. Still, their curiosity draws them to the hustle and bustle of civilization, and they eagerly observe and emulate the tenets of civilized life.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase:</em> Your <strong>Wisdom </strong>score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Bite Attack:</em>  Your jaws retain their needle-like fox teeth. You gain a [[/r 1d4]] <strong>piercing</strong> damage bite attack, with which you are proficient.

Short, reddish fur covers their bodies, their facial features are distinctly vulpine, and some even retain the backfacing knee of their bestial origins. Their difficulty passing as human necessitates an especially quick wit and cleverness, and most Kitsune Yako thrive in unexpected circumstances. Their possessive nature may extend to other people's belongings, and many Yako Kitsune follow the path of a thief or hoarder.

This race is a 3rd party homebrew race by Spoolicus.</em></p>\n<p>Warforged are bulky humanoids covered in plates of metal and stone. A skeleton of these materials supports woody fiber bundles that comprise a warforged's muscular system. Warforged bodies have an internal network of tubes filled with a bloodlike fluid that nourishes and lubricates their systems.</p>\n<p>The warforged were made as the ideal soldiers to serve in the devastating Last War. Although they are constructs, they have much in common with living creatures, including emotions and social bonds, and perhaps even souls.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Constructed Individuality<br /></span>Warforged heads have simple humanlike features. They have heavy brows, hinged toothless jaws, and no noses. A warforged's eyes sometimes glow when he or she experiences certain intense emotions. The forehead of each warforged bears a unique rune called a ghulra. These ghulra help give warforged a sense of individuality. Warforged possess an artificial and relatively sexless shape. They don't reproduce like other humanoids. A warforged can modify its body, adding and removing limbs as necessary. A warforged feels pain only from real injury. These physical modifications allow warforged to vary in appearance as much as any other humanoids.</p>\n<p>Warforged can have unique personality traits, though, as they are constructs, those are restricted in some ways. They experience anger, pain, fear, and hatred like their human creators. All warforged naturally seem reserved, stoic, and pensive, hiding an array of emotions behind their inexpressive metallic faces. Their faces were not designed to display facial expressions, so it can seem like they are distant to the conversation.</p>\n<p>Despite their lack of physical facial expressions, they're not completely without them, as their eyes tend to brighten when experiencing strong or specific emotions. Some warforged have their faces modified to be more expressive for their companion's comfort, but these expressions are learned rather than natural and often appear stilted and awkward.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">A New Perspective<br /></span></span>Some warforged can be incredibly naive and lack a sense of introspection. However, many others are the opposite and question their existence, they wonder if, as constructs, they have souls, and ask what becomes of them in the after life. The more intelligent warforged create complex philosophies about what they perceive and learn. Though warforged can show loyalty to religions and organizations, typically they become loyal to a small group of comrades.</p>\n<p>Warforged often have little life experience as they have spent most of their time working towards one specific duty, usually soldiering. If there is one interest all warforged share it is their love of working and the satisfaction of a job well done. Many create endless lists of goals and chores to feed that feeling. They take pride in their work and can work incredibly hard, both traits that make them dislike idleness and failure.</p>\n<p>Warforged can excel at most tasks, having a single-minded efficiency, especially in combat related roles. But this same single-mindedness can often translate to a lack of creativity and they can be easily surprised or \"outflanked.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\"><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Warforged Names<br /></span></span></span></span>Because most warforged have bodies that resemble males, they identify themselves as males and prefer to be called \"he\" rather than \"it.\" Some warforged adopt female names, though most warforged have simple names related to their jobs, abilities, or military positions.<br />Warforged often accept the names or the nicknames that their comrades give them, although some search long for particular names that define them.

In modern tales dragons are also keenly intelligent, long-lived, and magical. They lead lesser monsters, breathe elemental destruction upon those who displease them, and even demand sacrifices from mere mortals.</p>\n<p>These are the traits of power, in all its forms. Even the dragon’s hoarding of wealth is a representation of a form of power. From a human perspective, dragons are the pinnacle of evolution and the supreme creatures on the material plane. Dragons agree with this assessment.</p>\n<p>A Dragon is both a race, background, and class. You can find the class (and the background) in the Classes compendium.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Creating a Dragon Character<br /></span>The biggest question when creating a Dragon player character is: why is a dragon accompanying a bunch of humanoids on their adventures? Are you seeking to build up your treasure hoard, trying to follow your ideals, or just curious about the world?</p>\n<p>Starting dragon PCs are young dragons, between one and five years old. The hatchling background supposes that your dragon was raised by humanoids, or has at least spent substantial time around them, so you’re familiar with their languages and customs.</p>\n<p>Your choice of dragon species also determines many things about your character’s personality - or at least, determines what other people will think. A metallic dragon may find themselves beseeched by the weak and helpless wherever they go, with expectations of aid and heroism. Chromatic dragons are mostly evil in nature. Evil characters usually don’t make good PCs because their selfishness can cause conflict between party members. A good or neutral chromatic dragon will still face fear, mistrust, or even outright hostility from otherwise-civilized people, until they have proven themselves virtuous.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Dragon Names<br /></span>Dragons have personal names in the Draconic language, given by their parents at birth or selected by themselves. Dragons don’t put much emphasis on gender, so the same names are used by both male and female dragons. In addition, most dragons adopt an epithet — a grandiose nickname in the common tongue, which is easier for lesser creatures to understand and remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Names:</strong> Aeglyl, Cuth, Ferzath, Lareth, Nymmurh, Vuthavyth, Valeijgix, Svaergithaustrat, Aussirloex, Haurachmajak, Molikethend, Rylzrayrth, Thraethurkear, Ocuirisk, Gixustraterenesj, Dartakepesk, Adalon, Caexoth, Casarial, Grinnsira, Ixenloreat, Lymrith, Malazan, Naelere, Sirvinhandra.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Epithets:</strong> Blacksteel, Bloodtalon, Bravewing, Deathfrost, Fatebringer, Flamingdeath, Gemscale, Nightwind, Shadowfaith, Starseer, Stoneripper, Stormwrath, Sweetstring, Swordtooth, Toothless.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Dragon Traits<br /></span>Your dragon character has the following racial traits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ability Score Increase:</span> Your <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Charisma</strong> scores increases by 1. </li>\n<li> </li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Age:</span> The lifecycle of a dragon has a magical component. You are a dragon wyrmling less than five years old. Your size will increase as you gain levels in the Dragon class, regardless of age. A dragon’s natural lifespan is around 1200 years, although some live much longer.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Alignment:</span> Dragons tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war of good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). You are not typical of your race and maychoose any alignment.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Size:</span> Your body is about 3 ft. long with a 3 ft. neck and 4 ft. tail.You weigh around 70 lbs. Your size is small.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is <strong>25 feet</strong>.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Dragon Sight:</span> You have darkvision up to a range of <strong>60 feet</strong>.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Non-humanoid:</span> Your creature type is dragon, not humanoid. As such, you are affected by abilities that affect dragons, and you are not affected by abilities that affect humanoids and not dragons. Your claws cause you to have disadvantage with tools and weapons made for humanoids that you are not proficient with. Thematically, your DM may decide to have you use barding instead of armor.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Bite:</span> You are proficient with your bite attack.

As an action, you may exhale a <strong>5-foot </strong>wide and <strong>15-feet</strong> long stream that deals [[/r 2d6]] damage of your subtype element. Enemies cought in the stream may make a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong>, with the DC equal to 8 + your proficiency modifier + your <strong>Constitution </strong>modifier. On a success, they take half damage. You can use your breath attack once per short rest.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Lair:</span> Dragon PC's may feel left out during item rewards due to their class and race. You can use lair rules to help eleviate the issue. In order to establish a lair, a dragon must have unhindered access to, and spend a long rest in, the area designated as a lair. Precious or magic items count toward the horde total, and the GM has full discretion over what is precious and the value of magic items toward the hoard.

Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.
