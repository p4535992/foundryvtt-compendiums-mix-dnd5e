Unlike other classes like grounder and heavy, you are mobile and agile. It would be unlikely that you would wield a pistol with a full functioning rifle on their backs. You walk light, often near the front lines or scouting far ahead of a unit. You are not required to carry a shovel or plant explosives.

It will not only set your play style, but your potential personality as well. There is admittedly some theatrics involved, regardless of the choice, a talent picked up outside of standard military training channels. No doubt, you probably picked up a few tricks through specialized trainers and even practice. You might have possessed a background in law enforcement or been a crime lord’s hired thug. There was a reason why you never held a rifle—it was either never given to you, or the details of your profession precluded its use.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You may be required to be agile, sometimes clandestine. You have no problem intimidating people with your appearance and demeanor and don’t require some phallic compensation to aid in that. You can admit being somewhat of a cliché—the question is, do you embrace it? And if so, which one—the ancient American west or the later cinematic bullet ballet artist. Oddly enough, both roles have been embraced in this new world.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a gunslinger, you gain

Thankfully, beyond the simple aura of your charisma, you're also clever enough to know what to say at the right times to have the greatest effect. You know that how you speak means more than the words themselves. Even if you're not the leader of the group, you often do most of the talking when the need arrives.

The DC to resist your…well…behavior is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Biting Taunt</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You are able to scream an obscenity that is shockingly personal and vile to your opponent. As an action, you can target an enemy that can hear and understand you. It makes a Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the beginning of your next turn. A target that succeeds on the DC has advantage on additional saving throws against this effect until you finish a long rest.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Cognitive Empathy</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The truth is written in their faces. Through interpreting microexpressions, body language, and other aspects of applied psychology, you are able read the thoughts of certain individuals. As an action, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you and that has an Intelligence of 4 or higher. It&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">makes a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, you learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what it is most likely to do in the immediate future and what could possibly be on its mind. You also gain insight into its reasoning (if any) and/or its emotional state. This effect last until the end of your next turn or until you break line of sight.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Faceman</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">It’s all about the personality. Select one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill or one item proficiency. As an action, double your proficiency bonus with the next check made with that skill or item. You can select </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">faceman </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">a second time and select another skill or item.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Fascination</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You are, in fact, the most interesting person in the world…at least to your target. As an action, you can attempt to charm a target. It must be able to hear and understand you. It makes a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the creature is not only charmed by you but by all your allies the target can see. The charmed effect ends if the target suffers damage or five minutes have passed. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target makes the saving throw, you recover the use of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">fascination </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">but cannot use it against the same target until you finish a long rest. You can select </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">fascination </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">a second time and gain a second use before finishing a long rest.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Iceman</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you suffer a critical hit, you regain 1 lost Hit Die.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Know the Signs</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You have advantage against any Charisma and Wisdom saving throws.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Mind Twist</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">More so than insulting a target, you say something so bizarre (or perhaps amazingly insightful), the target is force to take time to think it over. As an action, you can target an enemy that can hear and understand you. It makes a Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, it is stunned until the beginning of your next turn. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target makes the saving throw, you recover the use of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">mind twist </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">but cannot use it against the same target until you finish a long rest. You can select </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">mind twist </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">a second time and gain a second use before finishing a long rest.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Poker Face</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You are immune to being frightened or charmed. Additionally, all allies that can see you have advantage against being frightened or charmed as well.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Polyglot</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You learn three additional languages. You also gain one additional language every three levels from now on.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Possible Sociopath</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You have resistance to psychic damage, as well as having advantage on saving throws against any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Veneer</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A disguise kit is only the beginning; outside of clothing and make-up, you can now alter your voice and mannerisms. You can also mimic specific people. If attempting a generic person, the disguise is near flawless (you have advantage on the disguise kit). Regardless if you are mimicking a specific or generic person, if your ability check to create a visual disguise is less than your Charisma saving throw DC, you can use that instead.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Winning Smile</strong><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Before making a skill check for a skill you are proficient with, you can instead set your roll to your ability score. When you use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">winning smile</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

It will not only set your play style, but your potential personality as well. There is admittedly some theatrics involved, regardless of the choice, a talent picked up outside of standard military training channels. No doubt, you probably picked up a few tricks through specialized trainers and even practice. You might have possessed a background in law enforcement or been a crime lord’s hired thug. There was a reason why you never held a rifle—it was either never given to you, or the details of your profession precluded its use.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You may be required to be agile, sometimes clandestine. You have no problem intimidating people with your appearance and demeanor and don’t require some phallic compensation to aid in that. You can admit being somewhat of a cliché—the question is, do you embrace it? And if so, which one—the ancient American west or the later cinematic bullet ballet artist. Oddly enough, both roles have been embraced in this new world.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a gunslinger, you gain

class=\"fontstyle2\">Wielding two one-handed small arms is the same as wielding two light melee weapons for the purposes of two-weapon fighting. As such, you can use a bonus action to attack with your second small arm. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless the modifier is a negative. At 6</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you no longer have this limitation, and can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>One Weapon</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If wielding only one one-handed small arm, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. This increases to +6 at 6</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CONVERGING FIRE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, when attacking a creature 5 feet or closer with one or two one-handed small arms, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and a +2 bonus to AC.<br></span></p>\n<h2>KATA<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you are able to use kata exploits fueled by kata points. You have 4 kata points at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, gaining 1 additional point every third level beginning at 2</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">nd </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level.

Certain kata exploits also cost more than one point. At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can only use one exploit per turn.&nbsp; This increases to two at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Abnormally Fast</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Spend 1 kata as part of your movement to double your speed until the end of your turn. If you are hit with an attack before the beginning of your next turn, you gain 1 kata.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Between The Eyes</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1&nbsp;<br></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Spend 1 kata before making a ranged attack roll to have advantage on that attack roll. If both attack rolls hit, double your attribute modifier damage. If both miss, you regain 1 kata.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Blood In The Eyes</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata as a reaction if an enemy scores a critical hit on you to make a ranged attack against the triggering enemy. If you hit, your attack is also a critical hit. If you miss by 5 or more, you regain 1 kata.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Boundary Threshold</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>If you are within 5 feet of at least two enemies, you can spend 1 kata along with 30 feet of movement to make one ranged attack to one of those enemies.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Classic Tumble</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata as a reaction when hit with an attack or if you fail a Dexterity saving throw. You take only ¼ damage.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Equilibrium</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata as part of a reaction when an enemy misses with a ranged attack—you make a ranged attack. If you score a critical hit with said attack, you recover 1 kata.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Hydrostatic Shot</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata after hitting a target; you inflict additional damage equal to your level, and if the creature is your size or smaller and moves or attacks before the start of your next turn, you can knock the enemy prone as a reaction.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Just One Bullet</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata before an attack action to add your Wisdom modifier to all damage rolls until the end of your turn. If any attack rolls you make on your turn score a critical hit, you gain 1 kata (max 1).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Kinesics</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata on your turn: your movement is not reduced through difficult terrain, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks, and all attacks against you have disadvantage until the beginning of your next turn. If you suffer more than one hit while </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">kinesics </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">is in effect, you regain 1 kata.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Limber Up</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>Spend 1 kata at the beginning of your turn to have advantage on Dexterity and Strength ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws until the end of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rapid Kill</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 2<br>Spend 2 kata after hitting a creature to turn that hit into a critical hit.</span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Way Of The Gun</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 1<br>If you hit a creature at least 20 feet away, spend 1 kata to gain an additional attack against one additional enemy within 5 feet of the first target.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Weak Spot</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Kata Cost: 4<br>Spend 4 kata after hitting a target; you gain a damage bonus to every subsequent hit on that specific target equal to your Wisdom bonus until the target is killed.<br></span></p>\n<h2>ARCHETYPE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you choose an archetype.

You cannot use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">procedural memory </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">if you have disadvantage.

Instead, it is designed for self-control and mental clarity. Some practitioners refuse to apply their discipline in a violent fashion, believing to do so would be a failure of their philosophy. For others, to commit this practice to violence is a&nbsp; logical progression. Some take this to an extreme, using it only to benefit themselves. Others are considered heroes, fighting for noble causes and refusing to stand idle while the innocent suffer.

This does not affect your martial artist combo chain tier.&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you move at least 20 feet towards a creature and make an unarmed (kick) attack as your Attack action, you have advantage on the attack.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once per discipline activation, if you score a critical hit against a target your size or smaller, you inflict maximum damage.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">After you select this discipline a third time, you can inflict maximum damage with a critical hit twice per activation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Tiger Claw</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You adore getting close, real close. Getting within your enemy’s reach, you hope to prevent a strong counterattack. And you kick too. After activating, you gain the following bonuses:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You gain a +5 bonus to speed.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can spend 20 feet of movement and move to occupy the same space as your opponent—you no longer occupy a space around said opponent and allies can attack through you. Any target occupying your space cannot use the Disengage action.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you hit a target with an unarmed attack, you can use a bonus action to inflict additional claw (slashing) damage equal to your attack modifier. This damage is not part of the same attack action and thus is not multiplied with a critical hit.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">After you select this discipline a third time, your

Thankfully, your strengths depend on that. Some call you empathic while others claim you just have good instincts. You may have cut your teeth as a psychologist or a confidence artist. You can spot a liar by their puckering lips and lazy eyes. You sense the heat of attraction and the searing loathing of those obsessed with violence. Your words have been known to disarm, sooth, or enrage. When shooting is not the solution, you’re the only that can save the situation. You’re the smooth talker, the negotiator, and the haggler. When a gun is pointed at your head or when dangling off a cliff, your first response is “can’t we discuss this?”<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\">PLAYING A FACE</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You’re at your best when bullets are not flying.

Unlike other classes like grounder and heavy, you are mobile and agile. It would be unlikely that you would wield a pistol with a full functioning rifle on their backs. You walk light, often near the front lines or scouting far ahead of a unit. You are not required to carry a shovel or plant explosives. Their purpose is singular, if not slightly selfish.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A GUNSLINGER<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Decide on the number of weapons you’ll be wielding in combat. It will not only set your play style, but your potential personality as well. There is admittedly some theatrics involved, regardless of the choice, a talent picked up outside of standard military training channels. No doubt, you probably picked up a few tricks through specialized trainers and even practice. You might have possessed a background in law enforcement or been a crime lord’s hired thug. There was a reason why you never held a rifle—it was either never given to you, or the details of your profession precluded its use.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You may be required to be agile, sometimes clandestine. You have no problem intimidating people with your appearance and demeanor and don’t require some phallic compensation to aid in that. You can admit being somewhat of a cliché—the question is, do you embrace it? And if so, which one—the ancient American west or the later cinematic bullet ballet artist. Oddly enough, both roles have been embraced in this new world.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a gunslinger, you gain

Despite any ranged combat skills you may possess, you prefer to make things personal. You have practiced day and night in the perfection of your craft. There may be countless reasons why you prefer close combat over firearms, but the primary one is usually selfempowerment.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial artist, your strength relies on your lethality in every situation. You require no augmentation, no steel or explosives to articulate your skill. The martial artist’s weapons cannot be removed. There is no scanner or sensor to identify one as a threat. You can suppress opponents without causing harm; remove a threat without making a sound. Firearms are a final, violent solution and most times a restrained hand is needed.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">PLAYING A MARTIAL ARTIST<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial artist, you are a non-magical alternative to the more clichéd official monk. You follow similar ideas, but there is less an emphasis on up magical effects in exchange for attacks that blur the lines. There is also a reduction on the spiritual and religious allusions. Everything that defines a martial artist is a talent that could have been taught in either a lifetime in a monastery or weeknights at the gym.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Your origin as a martial artist is partially based on your skills, feats, and archetype (if you choose to follow one). It is very possible that you have never held a firearm in your life, and such a proficiency can be ignored.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">And you know kung-fu.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The playing of a martial artist relies on the stringing of subsequent hits, called a combo-string. There is a risk-reward system in place, where carrying a longer string of successful hits can allow a more powerful finishing move. All other class features aid in this combat style.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial

If you roll the maximum result, add +1 damage.&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You gain proficiency with all medium and heavy armor.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You have advantage when attempting to shove a target.

You always begin a battle on tier 1, inflicting 1d6 damage with unarmed attacks.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">After you hit an enemy and inflict damage, you escalate to the next tier, where your damage dice increases for the next attack. Alternately, on tiers 2, 3, 4, or 5, after hitting a target, you can perform a finishing move. If you don’t perform a finishing move, the combo chain can continue, escalating to the next tier (if there is one). When you perform a finishing move, miss on an attack roll, or fail to make an attack before the end of your next turn, you restart the combo chain at tier 1.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You must decide to perform a finishing move after a successful attack, and on the same turn as one. When you reach the maximum tier allowed by your level, you can sustain the chain and your damage dice for as long</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">as possible, but remember, the chain ends—reducing you back to tier 1—if you miss on an attack roll or don’t make one until the end of your next turn.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can only string a combo chain to tier 3.

Double both your damage&nbsp; dice and ability modifier to your last hit.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Circular Attack</strong>: You spin your leg around to catch another opponent. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a single additional melee attack (at the same tier) against one other creature in reach (different than the one that escalated the combo chain) as part of the same action as the last hit. If you score a hit, you gain an additional identical attack this turn against a new creature different than the first and second.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ground &amp; Pound</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, you use your agility and strength to knock the target prone (the creature must be your size or smaller). You can then either use a Disengage action or have advantage on your next attack against the target.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Surging Punch</strong>: You channel your willpower, focus your energy, and let out a roar. After resolving damage for your last hit, the target is pushed 5 feet and has disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn (the creature must be your size or smaller).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 3 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Counter</strong>: You assume a defensive stance. After resolving damage for your last hit, you gain a +2 bonus to AC for one minute (ten rounds) or until you move. If a creature hits you, you can use a reaction to make a melee attack against the triggering enemy.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Soul Fist</strong>: Your enemy doesn’t know it yet, but it’s about to have a real bad day. After resolving your last hit, you can disengage from the target. Additionally, the target you hit last hit suffers additional damage equal to your attack ability score at the beginning of its next turn.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spinning Attack</strong>: Like a hurricane, either you spin in the air or your enemy does—either way, someone’s getting hurt. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a melee attack at this tier to each enemy within ten feet of you. If you miss, the creature still suffers your ability modifier damage; if hit, the target is knocked prone.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ranbu</strong>: Double your last hit’s regular damage dice, and make additional melee attacks at this tier against the same creature until you miss twice or hit four times.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 4 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Zone: After resolving damage for your last hit, your damage die remains at this tier regardless of your combo chain tier for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Touch of Death</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, until the target is killed or five minutes have passed, the target’s speed is halved and it takes damage equal to half your level at the beginning of its turn. This damage value does not increase if you inflict this<br>finisher on the same target more than once.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Drop Hammer</strong>: If you are grabbing the last creature you hit (it must be your size or smaller), after resolving damage, you maneuver yourself to force your enemy into the ground. Make a Strength (Athletics) check with advantage and leap into the air. You inflict additional damage equal to your roll as you crash back down, possibly creating an impact crater, with cracks in the ground.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Xian</strong>: You achieve perfect clarity for a short while. After resolving damage for your last hit, all enemies in reach are pushed ten feet. You cannot be shoved and are resistant to all damage types for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 5 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spirit Bomb</strong>: One incredible strike—triple your attribute damage to your last hit, and the creature is incapacitated for five minutes or until the target suffers damage.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Falcon Punch</strong>: Your last attack is a critical hit, you inflict max damage, and a creature your size or smaller is shoved 30 feet. If the target hits an obstruction, it suffers additional damage equal to the remaining distance. The target may still pass through the obstruction.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Shun-Goku-Satsu</strong>: You perform an incredibly powerful sequence of attacks. After resolving damage for your last hit, make eight additional melee attacks against any number of enemies within ten feet of you (each target can only be attacked a maximum of three times). Additionally, all attacks on you miss until the beginning of your next turn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Limit Break</strong>: You’re about to drop, but you know you cannot afford to lose. After resolving damage for your last hit, you inflict additional damage equal to the hit points you are currently down from your total (maximum 50 hit points).<br></span></p>\n<h2>MARTIAL EXPLOIT<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">you can select one martial exploit from the list below.

Additionally, all ranged attacks with one-handed small arms made against targets 5 feet or closed can be considered melee attacks.</span> &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Calisthenics</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You gain a +2 damage bonus to melee damage rolls. You can select this exploit a second time and increase the damage bonus to +4, and select it a third time and increase the damage bonus to +6.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Gun-Something-Something</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You treat one-handed small arms as melee weapons when attacking targets at 5 feet or closer.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Maintain Chain</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Instead of using your Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest, you can expend them to prevent a break in your combo chain. If you miss (but don’t roll a natural 1), spend a Hit Die as part of your attack to turn that miss into a non-critical hit. There is no limit of how many Hit Dice you can expend this way per turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Marker</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When you hit an enemy that is in reach of you with a melee attack, it has disadvantage on any attacks that don’t include you as a target until the end of your next turn. The effect ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you move out of reach of that enemy, but not if the enemy moves out of reach of you.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Newaza</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are a master at ground fighting. You gain the following benefits: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature breaks from your grapple, you can use your reaction to attempt a grapple check on the same target.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have a +2 bonus to AC against any creature you are grappling.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You do not have disadvantage on melee attacks while prone. Enemies do not have advantage on you with non-reach melee attacks if you are prone.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Pound For Pound</strong><br></span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are a superior fighter in all respects. You gain the following benefits:<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature moves away from you, even with the disengage action, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed with it.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Redirection Of Energy</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When an enemy scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. When you use this exploit, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Additionally, any time a creature scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you have advantage on melee attacks against that creature until the end of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rhythm String</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After performing a finishing move, the tier of said finishing move is a bonus you receive on your next melee attack at tier 1 (for example, if you perform a tier 5 finishing move, your next attack at tier 1 receives a +5 bonus).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tag Team</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If an ally hits an enemy within 5-feet of you with a melee attack, you can deal additional damage to that hit equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier as a reaction. This does not count towards your combo-chain. </span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Ultra</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After hitting a creature, increase your combo chain tier by one and perform a finishing move. You must have access to the higher tier, and after using ultra, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Unarmed Expanded Profile</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Spend 30 feet of movement, and your unarmed attacks have reach until the beginning of your next turn. If you use this exploit, you cannot voluntarily move until the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Vicious Hook</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>Prerequisite</em>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">10</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Level Your melee attacks score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Wrestler</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You’re a classic brawler. You gain the following benefits:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If you are grappling a target, you have half cover from attacks from other targets. Additionally, any attack that misses you by 5 or less hits your grappled target instead.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When moving a grabbed creature your size or smaller, your speed is not reduced.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ARCHETYPE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">At 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you choose an archetype.

You require no augmentation, no steel or explosives to articulate your skill. The martial artist’s weapons cannot be removed. There is no scanner or sensor to identify one as a threat. You can suppress opponents without causing harm; remove a threat without making a sound. Firearms are a final, violent solution and most times a restrained hand is needed.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">PLAYING A MARTIAL ARTIST<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial artist, you are a non-magical alternative to the more clichéd official monk. You follow similar ideas, but there is less an emphasis on up magical effects in exchange for attacks that blur the lines. There is also a reduction on the spiritual and religious allusions. Everything that defines a martial artist is a talent that could have been taught in either a lifetime in a monastery or weeknights at the gym.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Your origin as a martial artist is partially based on your skills, feats, and archetype (if you choose to follow one). It is very possible that you have never held a firearm in your life, and such a proficiency can be ignored.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">And you know kung-fu.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The playing of a martial artist relies on the stringing of subsequent hits, called a combo-string. There is a risk-reward system in place, where carrying a longer string of successful hits can allow a more powerful finishing move. All other class features aid in this combat style.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial

6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, select either Dexterity or Strength as your ability for attack and damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Dexterity</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you use Dexterity as your attack/damage ability, you gain the following abilities:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When reaching combo-chain tier 2, you gain a +1 bonus to melee attack rolls.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You add half your Dexterity modifier (round down) to your normal Dexterity modifier when determining your AC with light armor (effectively x1.5 your modifier to AC—a +4 Dex bonus becomes a +6).&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of Strength (Athletics) to make or sustain&nbsp; grapple checks.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Strength</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></h4>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you use Strength as your attack/damage ability, you gain the following abilities:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can re-roll any damage die roll of 1 until the result is other than 1. If you roll the maximum result, add +1 damage.&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You gain proficiency with all medium and heavy armor.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You have advantage when attempting to shove a target. A shoved creature is pushed 10 feet away instead of 5 feet.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">COMBO</span> CHAIN</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you gain the ability to string fighting maneuvers together in order to unleash more powerful attacks. You always begin a battle on tier 1, inflicting 1d6 damage with unarmed attacks.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">After you hit an enemy and inflict damage, you escalate to the next tier, where your damage dice increases for the next attack. Alternately, on tiers 2, 3, 4, or 5, after hitting a target, you can perform a finishing move. If you don’t perform a finishing move, the combo chain can continue, escalating to the next tier (if there is one). When you perform a finishing move, miss on an attack roll, or fail to make an attack before the end of your next turn, you restart the combo chain at tier 1.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You must decide to perform a finishing move after a successful attack, and on the same turn as one. When you reach the maximum tier allowed by your level, you can sustain the chain and your damage dice for as long</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">as possible, but remember, the chain ends—reducing you back to tier 1—if you miss on an attack roll or don’t make one until the end of your next turn.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can only string a combo chain to tier 3.

Double both your damage&nbsp; dice and ability modifier to your last hit.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Circular Attack</strong>: You spin your leg around to catch another opponent. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a single additional melee attack (at the same tier) against one other creature in reach (different than the one that escalated the combo chain) as part of the same action as the last hit. If you score a hit, you gain an additional identical attack this turn against a new creature different than the first and second.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ground &amp; Pound</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, you use your agility and strength to knock the target prone (the creature must be your size or smaller). You can then either use a Disengage action or have advantage on your next attack against the target.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Surging Punch</strong>: You channel your willpower, focus your energy, and let out a roar. After resolving damage for your last hit, the target is pushed 5 feet and has disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn (the creature must be your size or smaller).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 3 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Counter</strong>: You assume a defensive stance. After resolving damage for your last hit, you gain a +2 bonus to AC for one minute (ten rounds) or until you move. If a creature hits you, you can use a reaction to make a melee attack against the triggering enemy.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Soul Fist</strong>: Your enemy doesn’t know it yet, but it’s about to have a real bad day. After resolving your last hit, you can disengage from the target. Additionally, the target you hit last hit suffers additional damage equal to your attack ability score at the beginning of its next turn.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spinning Attack</strong>: Like a hurricane, either you spin in the air or your enemy does—either way, someone’s getting hurt. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a melee attack at this tier to each enemy within ten feet of you. If you miss, the creature still suffers your ability modifier damage; if hit, the target is knocked prone.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ranbu</strong>: Double your last hit’s regular damage dice, and make additional melee attacks at this tier against the same creature until you miss twice or hit four times.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 4 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Zone: After resolving damage for your last hit, your damage die remains at this tier regardless of your combo chain tier for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Touch of Death</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, until the target is killed or five minutes have passed, the target’s speed is halved and it takes damage equal to half your level at the beginning of its turn. This damage value does not increase if you inflict this<br>finisher on the same target more than once.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Drop Hammer</strong>: If you are grabbing the last creature you hit (it must be your size or smaller), after resolving damage, you maneuver yourself to force your enemy into the ground. Make a Strength (Athletics) check with advantage and leap into the air. You inflict additional damage equal to your roll as you crash back down, possibly creating an impact crater, with cracks in the ground.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Xian</strong>: You achieve perfect clarity for a short while. After resolving damage for your last hit, all enemies in reach are pushed ten feet. You cannot be shoved and are resistant to all damage types for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 5 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spirit Bomb</strong>: One incredible strike—triple your attribute damage to your last hit, and the creature is incapacitated for five minutes or until the target suffers damage.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Falcon Punch</strong>: Your last attack is a critical hit, you inflict max damage, and a creature your size or smaller is shoved 30 feet. If the target hits an obstruction, it suffers additional damage equal to the remaining distance. The target may still pass through the obstruction.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Shun-Goku-Satsu</strong>: You perform an incredibly powerful sequence of attacks. After resolving damage for your last hit, make eight additional melee attacks against any number of enemies within ten feet of you (each target can only be attacked a maximum of three times). Additionally, all attacks on you miss until the beginning of your next turn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Limit Break</strong>: You’re about to drop, but you know you cannot afford to lose. After resolving damage for your last hit, you inflict additional damage equal to the hit points you are currently down from your total (maximum 50 hit points).<br></span></p>\n<h2>MARTIAL EXPLOIT<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">you can select one martial exploit from the list below.

If you miss (but don’t roll a natural 1), spend a Hit Die as part of your attack to turn that miss into a non-critical hit. There is no limit of how many Hit Dice you can expend this way per turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Marker</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When you hit an enemy that is in reach of you with a melee attack, it has disadvantage on any attacks that don’t include you as a target until the end of your next turn. The effect ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you move out of reach of that enemy, but not if the enemy moves out of reach of you.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Newaza</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are a master at ground fighting. You gain the following benefits: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature breaks from your grapple, you can use your reaction to attempt a grapple check on the same target.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have a +2 bonus to AC against any creature you are grappling.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You do not have disadvantage on melee attacks while prone.

You gain the following benefits:<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature moves away from you, even with the disengage action, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed with it.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Redirection Of Energy</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When an enemy scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. When you use this exploit, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Additionally, any time a creature scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you have advantage on melee attacks against that creature until the end of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rhythm String</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After performing a finishing move, the tier of said finishing move is a bonus you receive on your next melee attack at tier 1 (for example, if you perform a tier 5 finishing move, your next attack at tier 1 receives a +5 bonus).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tag Team</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If an ally hits an enemy within 5-feet of you with a melee attack, you can deal additional damage to that hit equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier as a reaction. This does not count towards your combo-chain. </span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Ultra</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After hitting a creature, increase your combo chain tier by one and perform a finishing move. You must have access to the higher tier, and after using ultra, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Unarmed Expanded Profile</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Spend 30 feet of movement, and your unarmed attacks have reach until the beginning of your next turn. If you use this exploit, you cannot voluntarily move until the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Vicious Hook</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>Prerequisite</em>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">10</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Level Your melee attacks score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Wrestler</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You’re a classic brawler. You gain the following benefits:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If you are grappling a target, you have half cover from attacks from other targets. Additionally, any attack that misses you by 5 or less hits your grappled target instead.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When moving a grabbed creature your size or smaller, your speed is not reduced.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ARCHETYPE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">At 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you choose an archetype.

It’s not enough just to be athletic: you have to keep your eyes and mind sharp, to gauge distances, crawlspaces, and the shortest possible route even if it involves some death-defying feat of acrobatic skill. You can keep an entire landscape in mind, analyzing paths and routes of escape, even when everyone else just sees walls.

Despite any ranged combat skills you may possess, you prefer to make things personal. You have practiced day and night in the perfection of your craft. There may be countless reasons why you prefer close combat over firearms, but the primary one is usually selfempowerment.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial artist, your strength relies on your lethality in every situation. You require no augmentation, no steel or explosives to articulate your skill. The martial artist’s weapons cannot be removed. There is no scanner or sensor to identify one as a threat. You can suppress opponents without causing harm; remove a threat without making a sound. Firearms are a final, violent solution and most times a restrained hand is needed.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">PLAYING A MARTIAL ARTIST<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial artist, you are a non-magical alternative to the more clichéd official monk. You follow similar ideas, but there is less an emphasis on up magical effects in exchange for attacks that blur the lines. There is also a reduction on the spiritual and religious allusions. Everything that defines a martial artist is a talent that could have been taught in either a lifetime in a monastery or weeknights at the gym.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Your origin as a martial artist is partially based on your skills, feats, and archetype (if you choose to follow one). It is very possible that you have never held a firearm in your life, and such a proficiency can be ignored.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">And you know kung-fu.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The playing of a martial artist relies on the stringing of subsequent hits, called a combo-string. There is a risk-reward system in place, where carrying a longer string of successful hits can allow a more powerful finishing move. All other class features aid in this combat style.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">CLASS FEATURES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a martial

6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, select either Dexterity or Strength as your ability for attack and damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Dexterity</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you use Dexterity as your attack/damage ability, you gain the following abilities:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When reaching combo-chain tier 2, you gain a +1 bonus to melee attack rolls.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You add half your Dexterity modifier (round down) to your normal Dexterity modifier when determining your AC with light armor (effectively x1.5 your modifier to AC—a +4 Dex bonus becomes a +6).&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of Strength (Athletics) to make or sustain&nbsp; grapple checks.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Strength</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br></span></h4>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you use Strength as your attack/damage ability, you gain the following abilities:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can re-roll any damage die roll of 1 until the result is other than 1. If you roll the maximum result, add +1 damage.&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You gain proficiency with all medium and heavy armor.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You have advantage when attempting to shove a target. A shoved creature is pushed 10 feet away instead of 5 feet.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">COMBO</span> CHAIN</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you gain the ability to string fighting maneuvers together in order to unleash more powerful attacks. You always begin a battle on tier 1, inflicting 1d6 damage with unarmed attacks.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">After you hit an enemy and inflict damage, you escalate to the next tier, where your damage dice increases for the next attack. Alternately, on tiers 2, 3, 4, or 5, after hitting a target, you can perform a finishing move. If you don’t perform a finishing move, the combo chain can continue, escalating to the next tier (if there is one). When you perform a finishing move, miss on an attack roll, or fail to make an attack before the end of your next turn, you restart the combo chain at tier 1.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You must decide to perform a finishing move after a successful attack, and on the same turn as one. When you reach the maximum tier allowed by your level, you can sustain the chain and your damage dice for as long</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">as possible, but remember, the chain ends—reducing you back to tier 1—if you miss on an attack roll or don’t make one until the end of your next turn.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can only string a combo chain to tier 3. This increases to tier 4 at 9</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and tier 5 at 13</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Note</strong>: You can use melee weapons with combo chain but utilize the table’s damage die instead of the weapon’s.

Double both your damage&nbsp; dice and ability modifier to your last hit.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Circular Attack</strong>: You spin your leg around to catch another opponent. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a single additional melee attack (at the same tier) against one other creature in reach (different than the one that escalated the combo chain) as part of the same action as the last hit. If you score a hit, you gain an additional identical attack this turn against a new creature different than the first and second.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ground &amp; Pound</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, you use your agility and strength to knock the target prone (the creature must be your size or smaller). You can then either use a Disengage action or have advantage on your next attack against the target.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Surging Punch</strong>: You channel your willpower, focus your energy, and let out a roar. After resolving damage for your last hit, the target is pushed 5 feet and has disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn (the creature must be your size or smaller).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 3 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Counter</strong>: You assume a defensive stance. After resolving damage for your last hit, you gain a +2 bonus to AC for one minute (ten rounds) or until you move. If a creature hits you, you can use a reaction to make a melee attack against the triggering enemy.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Soul Fist</strong>: Your enemy doesn’t know it yet, but it’s about to have a real bad day. After resolving your last hit, you can disengage from the target. Additionally, the target you hit last hit suffers additional damage equal to your attack ability score at the beginning of its next turn.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spinning Attack</strong>: Like a hurricane, either you spin in the air or your enemy does—either way, someone’s getting hurt. After resolving damage for your last hit, make a melee attack at this tier to each enemy within ten feet of you. If you miss, the creature still suffers your ability modifier damage; if hit, the target is knocked prone.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ranbu</strong>: Double your last hit’s regular damage dice, and make additional melee attacks at this tier against the same creature until you miss twice or hit four times.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 4 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Zone: After resolving damage for your last hit, your damage die remains at this tier regardless of your combo chain tier for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Touch of Death</strong>: After resolving damage for your last hit, until the target is killed or five minutes have passed, the target’s speed is halved and it takes damage equal to half your level at the beginning of its turn. This damage value does not increase if you inflict this<br>finisher on the same target more than once.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Drop Hammer</strong>: If you are grabbing the last creature you hit (it must be your size or smaller), after resolving damage, you maneuver yourself to force your enemy into the ground. Make a Strength (Athletics) check with advantage and leap into the air. You inflict additional damage equal to your roll as you crash back down, possibly creating an impact crater, with cracks in the ground.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Xian</strong>: You achieve perfect clarity for a short while. After resolving damage for your last hit, all enemies in reach are pushed ten feet. You cannot be shoved and are resistant to all damage types for one minute (ten rounds).<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">TIER 5 FINISHING MOVES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Spirit Bomb</strong>: One incredible strike—triple your attribute damage to your last hit, and the creature is incapacitated for five minutes or until the target suffers damage.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Falcon Punch</strong>: Your last attack is a critical hit, you inflict max damage, and a creature your size or smaller is shoved 30 feet. If the target hits an obstruction, it suffers additional damage equal to the remaining distance. The target may still pass through the obstruction.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Shun-Goku-Satsu</strong>: You perform an incredibly powerful sequence of attacks. After resolving damage for your last hit, make eight additional melee attacks against any number of enemies within ten feet of you (each target can only be attacked a maximum of three times). Additionally, all attacks on you miss until the beginning of your next turn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Limit Break</strong>: You’re about to drop, but you know you cannot afford to lose. After resolving damage for your last hit, you inflict additional damage equal to the hit points you are currently down from your total (maximum 50 hit points).<br></span></p>\n<h2>MARTIAL EXPLOIT<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">you can select one martial exploit from the list below.

Additionally, all ranged attacks with one-handed small arms made against targets 5 feet or closed can be considered melee attacks.</span> &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Calisthenics</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You gain a +2 damage bonus to melee damage rolls.

If you miss (but don’t roll a natural 1), spend a Hit Die as part of your attack to turn that miss into a non-critical hit. There is no limit of how many Hit Dice you can expend this way per turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Marker</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When you hit an enemy that is in reach of you with a melee attack, it has disadvantage on any attacks that don’t include you as a target until the end of your next turn. The effect ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you move out of reach of that enemy, but not if the enemy moves out of reach of you.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Newaza</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are a master at ground fighting. You gain the following benefits: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature breaks from your grapple, you can use your reaction to attempt a grapple check on the same target.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have a +2 bonus to AC against any creature you are grappling.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You do not have disadvantage on melee attacks while prone.

You gain the following benefits:<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If a creature moves away from you, even with the disengage action, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed with it.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Redirection Of Energy</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">When an enemy scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. When you use this exploit, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Additionally, any time a creature scores a critical hit on you with a melee attack, you have advantage on melee attacks against that creature until the end of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rhythm String</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After performing a finishing move, the tier of said finishing move is a bonus you receive on your next melee attack at tier 1 (for example, if you perform a tier 5 finishing move, your next attack at tier 1 receives a +5 bonus).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tag Team</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If an ally hits an enemy within 5-feet of you with a melee attack, you can deal additional damage to that hit equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier as a reaction. This does not count towards your combo-chain. </span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Ultra</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">After hitting a creature, increase your combo chain tier by one and perform a finishing move. You must have access to the higher tier, and after using ultra, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Unarmed Expanded Profile</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Spend 30 feet of movement, and your unarmed attacks have reach until the beginning of your next turn. If you use this exploit, you cannot voluntarily move until the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Vicious Hook</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>Prerequisite</em>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">10</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Level Your melee attacks score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Wrestler</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You’re a classic brawler. You gain the following benefits:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle1\">If you are grappling a target, you have half cover from attacks from other targets.

You cannot use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">procedural memory </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">if you have disadvantage. If you already have advantage, you still only get to re-roll one die result.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">LEET<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, anytime you have advantage on an attack roll, the target of your attack has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">INTENDED TARGET<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you are able to dispatch enemies with extreme prejudice.

The target must be within 20 feet of you.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">PACIFICATION<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 2</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">nd </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can concentrate all your energy into ensuring a clean kill, even to the risk of your own personal safety. Instead of using your Hit Dice to recover hit points, you can expend them during an action to turn an unfavorable attack roll to a natural 20.

At 6th level, if you hit your target with a melee weapon or a ranged weapon at 20 feet or closer, you can repeat the same attack against the same target as part of the same action. This attack is counted separately from the previous, so any benefits do not carry over.

Instead, it is designed for self-control and mental clarity. Some practitioners refuse to apply their discipline in a violent fashion, believing to do so would be a failure of their philosophy. For others, to commit this practice to violence is a&nbsp; logical progression. Some take this to an extreme, using it only to benefit themselves. Others are considered heroes, fighting for noble causes and refusing to stand idle while the innocent suffer.

Not only are you required to be proficient in Intelligence (Engineering), but you also must possess the appropriate Engineering kit. If so, then you can expend 5uc in widgets each day until you reach the market value of the item (this is called a build schedule). You must have widgets or parts on hand. Alternately, you can attempt to make an Intelligence (Engineering) check—the result is how much in uc you progress instead of taking the normal 5uc each day. This value can increase with the use of engineering kits.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #242021;\"><br>The tech level of your engineering kit affects the speed of your build, being a multiplier affecting the number of uc you can invest per day of use. A TL1 kit thus cannot affect your build time, while a TL5 kit allows you to spend 5 times more uc than normally for a day’s work.

It now suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls that don’t include you as a target. The effect ends if you move out of range or out of line of sight (like behind total cover), or don’t attack the same target before the end of your next turn (you don’t need to hit, just attack).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Cauterize</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use your action to heal an injured ally.

The effect ends if the target stands, if you leave the target's area, or if the target makes any kind of attack.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Member Of A Team</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can spend 30 feet of movement and select an ally within 5 feet. That ally can use the Disengage action without using her action on her next turn.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Slow Is Smooth</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When you move, you can reduce your speed by 10 feet and pull one ally within 5 feet with you.

The effect ends if you move out of range or out of line of sight (like behind total cover), or don’t attack the same target before the end of your next turn (you don’t need to hit, just attack).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Cauterize</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use your action to heal an injured ally.

You cannot use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">procedural memory </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">if you have disadvantage. If you already have advantage, you still only get to re-roll one die result.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">LEET<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, anytime you have advantage on an attack roll, the target of your attack has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">INTENDED TARGET<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you are able to dispatch enemies with extreme prejudice.

Instead of using your Hit Dice to recover hit points, you can expend them during an action to turn an unfavorable attack roll to a natural 20.

At 6th level, if you hit your target with a melee weapon or a ranged weapon at 20 feet or closer, you can repeat the same attack against the same target as part of the same action. This attack is counted separately from the previous, so any benefits do not carry over.

Instead, it is designed for self-control and mental clarity. Some practitioners refuse to apply their discipline in a violent fashion, believing to do so would be a failure of their philosophy. For others, to commit this practice to violence is a&nbsp; logical progression. Some take this to an extreme, using it only to benefit themselves. Others are considered heroes, fighting for noble causes and refusing to stand idle while the innocent suffer. These adventurers love sparring and often duel aggressively with allies to test their mettle and skill. Though not a requirement for friendship, it goes a long way to match a grandmaster in combat.

After activating, you gain the following bonuses:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature’s melee attack roll against you misses, the difference between the attack result and your AC becomes a damage bonus on your next melee attack. This attack must be made on your next turn against the target that missed you, and if you miss, the damage bonus is lost.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature’s melee attack roll against you is a natural 1, you can knock the target prone and make a melee attack as a reaction.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">After you select this discipline a third time, you knock the target prone and make a melee attack as a reaction if your enemy rolls a natural 1 or 2.<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Taekwondo<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">More defined by its powerful leg movements rather than hand strikes, your opponents should always keep their eyes on your feet. After activating, you gain the following bonuses:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you are not grappled or your legs otherwise restrained , your unarmed attacks increase their damage die by one step (1d4 &gt; 1d6 &gt; 1d8 &gt; 1d10 &gt; 1d12 &gt; 2d6 &gt; 2d8 &gt; 2d10). These are kick attacks. This does not affect your martial artist combo chain tier.&nbsp;<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you move at least 20 feet towards a creature and make an unarmed (kick) attack as your Attack action, you have advantage on the attack.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Once per discipline activation, if you score a critical hit against a target your size or smaller, you inflict maximum damage.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">After you select this discipline a third time, you can inflict maximum damage with a critical hit twice per activation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Tiger Claw</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You adore getting close, real close. Getting within your enemy’s reach, you hope to prevent a strong counterattack. And you kick too. After activating, you gain the following bonuses:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You gain a +5 bonus to speed.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can spend 20 feet of movement and move to occupy the same space as your opponent—you no longer occupy a space around said opponent and allies can attack through you. Any target occupying your space cannot use the Disengage action.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you hit a target with an unarmed attack, you can use a bonus action to inflict additional claw (slashing) damage equal to your attack modifier. This damage is not part of the same attack action and thus is not multiplied with a critical hit.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">After you select this discipline a third time, your

Not only are you required to be proficient in Intelligence (Engineering), but you also must possess the appropriate Engineering kit.

This can apply in the application of hand-to-hand combat, the use of melee weapons, or in the proficiency of small-arms. You might have lived on a farm, on a military base, or in a temple. You might have devoted your life to the implement of one craft or to the broad use of many. Your power comes from commitment. Your victory is due to training.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

Each command presence can also be temporarily boosted, after which you cannot boost it again until you finish a long rest.

Allies that can see and hear you have advantage on Constitution, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Exemplary Example (boost)</strong>: As an action, for the next minute (10 rounds), all allies gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Allies also gain advantage on Intelligence and Strength saving throws as well; the bonus from </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">exemplary example </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">increases to +2.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>FIELD ADVICE</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Using only your words, you call your comrades back from the most harmful of afflictions. Allies that can see and hear you double any effect that removes fatigue. Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest. These additional Hit Dice must be used immediately or are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, when you use </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">profound advice</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, each ally recovers hit points equal to a quarter of your current hit points.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Intimidating Mug</strong></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Opponents take one look at you and begin to rethink their approach. All enemies within 10 feet of you treat the area as difficult terrain.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Menacing Mug (boost)</strong>: As an action, you double the range of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">intimidating mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">for one minute (10 rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Increase the range to 20 feet, and you can use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">menacing mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">twice before needing to finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Mask Of Authority</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Your friends believe themselves better knowing you are around. All allies that can see and hear you can re -roll all 1s on their damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Personification of Authority (boost): </strong>Use an action, and for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.&nbsp;<br><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Allies re-roll all 1s and 2s on damage rolls; </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">personification of authority </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">improves to a +3 bonus to damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stand As One</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">As long as you stand, no one falls. All allies that can see and hear you reduce all damage inflicted on them by 1 (3 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Brotherhood (boost): </strong>As an action, you advise your allies on the best way to avoid damage. Select an energy type (acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder)—for one minute (10&nbsp;<br>rounds), all allies that can see you gain resistance to that energy type.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: All allies in range reduce all damage inflicted on them by 2 (6 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Strategic Precision</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You lead the attack, drawing allied fire to your target. If you hit a creature, pick one ally that can see or hear you—the targeted ally gains a +2 bonus to her next attack roll.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Strategic Superiority (boost): </strong>As an action, you convey an attack plan—for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the last target you hit until the beginning of your next turn. Your selected ally still only gains a +2 bonus.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Instead of a +2 bonus, the selected ally gains advantage.<br></span></p>\n<h2>FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, as an action, you can allow one ally within line of sight to take any action normally available to her as a reaction to you or as an additional action on her next turn.

When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Focus Target</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a bonus action, you can grant an ally within 5 feet of you a single ranged attack against the same creature you hit with a ranged attack this same turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Improvisation Is The Best Plan</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Use a bonus action to gain 1 additional reaction before the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mark Of The Puppeteer</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Any time an ally hits with an attack, you can use a reaction to shove that creature 5 feet as long as the target is not moved into hazardous terrain (like fire or a pit).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>No One Hits The Chief</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature hits you with a critical hit, all allies that can see or hear you have advantage on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn against the creature that scored the hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pat On The Back</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When the party takes a short rest, you can award any of your Hit Dice to an ally.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest.

This can apply in the application of hand-to-hand combat, the use of melee weapons, or in the proficiency of small-arms. You might have lived on a farm, on a military base, or in a temple. You might have devoted your life to the implement of one craft or to the broad use of many. Your power comes from commitment. Your victory is due to training.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

Each command presence can also be temporarily boosted, after which you cannot boost it again until you finish a long rest. Unless otherwise stat</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">ed, you gain no benefit from your own command presence.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 2</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">nd </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and again at 6</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 14</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, and 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can either select another command presence or increase the potential of a presence you already possess.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>By Example</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You don't keep back and order from a distance; you stand shoulder to shoulder with those you lead. Allies that can see and hear you have advantage on Constitution, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Exemplary Example (boost)</strong>: As an action, for the next minute (10 rounds), all allies gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Allies also gain advantage on Intelligence and Strength saving throws as well; the bonus from </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">exemplary example </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">increases to +2.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>FIELD ADVICE</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Using only your words, you call your comrades back from the most harmful of afflictions. Allies that can see and hear you double any effect that removes fatigue. Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest. These additional Hit Dice must be used immediately or are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, when you use </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">profound advice</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, each ally recovers hit points equal to a quarter of your current hit points.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Intimidating Mug</strong></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Opponents take one look at you and begin to rethink their approach. All enemies within 10 feet of you treat the area as difficult terrain.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Menacing Mug (boost)</strong>: As an action, you double the range of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">intimidating mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">for one minute (10 rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Increase the range to 20 feet, and you can use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">menacing mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">twice before needing to finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Mask Of Authority</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Your friends believe themselves better knowing you are around. All allies that can see and hear you can re -roll all 1s on their damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Personification of Authority (boost): </strong>Use an action, and for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.&nbsp;<br><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Allies re-roll all 1s and 2s on damage rolls; </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">personification of authority </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">improves to a +3 bonus to damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stand As One</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">As long as you stand, no one falls. All allies that can see and hear you reduce all damage inflicted on them by 1 (3 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Brotherhood (boost): </strong>As an action, you advise your allies on the best way to avoid damage. Select an energy type (acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder)—for one minute (10&nbsp;<br>rounds), all allies that can see you gain resistance to that energy type.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: All allies in range reduce all damage inflicted on them by 2 (6 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Strategic Precision</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You lead the attack, drawing allied fire to your target. If you hit a creature, pick one ally that can see or hear you—the targeted ally gains a +2 bonus to her next attack roll.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Strategic Superiority (boost): </strong>As an action, you convey an attack plan—for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the last target you hit until the beginning of your next turn. Your selected ally still only gains a +2 bonus.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Instead of a +2 bonus, the selected ally gains advantage.<br></span></p>\n<h2>FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, as an action, you can allow one ally within line of sight to take any action normally available to her as a reaction to you or as an additional action on her next turn. Additionally, you can swap your initia</span>tive order with another ally once per round.</p>\n<h2>Team Power</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and every fourth level after, you can select one </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">team power</span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. Several powers are only available to choose after level 5.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Autocratic</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an ally suffers a critical hit from a creature, you can use your reaction to give another ally a single attack against the creature that inflicted the critical hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Big Picture</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As an action, select one ally able to see and hear you. If the ally hits with an attack before the beginning of your next turn, that hit gains a damage bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Boar’s Head</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Spend 10 feet of movement to give an ally a 5-foot bonus to her speed until the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">boar’s head </span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">multiple times on your turn, but each ally cannot gain more than 5 feet of movement this way.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Control The Battle Theatre</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When rolling for initiative, you and each ally that can see or hear you has advantage on his or her initiative roll.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Face Slap</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5) Use an action to wake up one adjacent unconscious creature. If the target was unconscious from being reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she is healed to 1 hit point. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Focus Target</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a bonus action, you can grant an ally within 5 feet of you a single ranged attack against the same creature you hit with a ranged attack this same turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Improvisation Is The Best Plan</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Use a bonus action to gain 1 additional reaction before the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mark Of The Puppeteer</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Any time an ally hits with an attack, you can use a reaction to shove that creature 5 feet as long as the target is not moved into hazardous terrain (like fire or a pit).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>No One Hits The Chief</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature hits you with a critical hit, all allies that can see or hear you have advantage on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn against the creature that scored the hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pat On The Back</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When the party takes a short rest, you can award any of your Hit Dice to an ally. Allies cannot have more Hit Dice than their level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Plan of Attack</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can spend 10 feet of movement to move another ally 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pure Leader</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you hit an enemy with a ranged attack, you can inflict half damage and one ally can disengage from the same enemy and move up to half his speed.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Quick Patch</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use your action to administer aid to an ally—the target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6 / your level. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short or long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can select this trait multiple times, increasing the damage cured by 1d6 each time and gaining an additional use of quick patch between long rests.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Reading Body Language</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight), Wisdom (Survival), Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) checks (select one).

You have trained from an early age by choice or by inheritance to take the role of a combatant. Your natural gifts were discovered and focused into a lifelong dedication. This is not to assume you’re a warmonger, as such training comes with the responsibility to know restraint. For many, having the skills is a means for self-discovery. This can apply in the application of hand-to-hand combat, the use of melee weapons, or in the proficiency of small-arms. You might have lived on a farm, on a military base, or in a temple. You might have devoted your life to the implement of one craft or to the broad use of many. Your power comes from commitment. Your victory is due to training. A true warrior knows when to fight and what to learn when a defeat occurs.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

Unless otherwise stat</span> <span class=\"fontstyle0\">ed, you gain no benefit from your own command presence.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 2</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">nd </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and again at 6</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 14</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, and 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can either select another command presence or increase the potential of a presence you already possess.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>By Example</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You don't keep back and order from a distance; you stand shoulder to shoulder with those you lead. Allies that can see and hear you have advantage on Constitution, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Exemplary Example (boost)</strong>: As an action, for the next minute (10 rounds), all allies gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Allies also gain advantage on Intelligence and Strength saving throws as well; the bonus from </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">exemplary example </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">increases to +2.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>FIELD ADVICE</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Using only your words, you call your comrades back from the most harmful of afflictions. Allies that can see and hear you double any effect that removes fatigue. Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest. These additional Hit Dice must be used immediately or are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, when you use </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">profound advice</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, each ally recovers hit points equal to a quarter of your current hit points.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Intimidating Mug</strong></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Opponents take one look at you and begin to rethink their approach. All enemies within 10 feet of you treat the area as difficult terrain.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Menacing Mug (boost)</strong>: As an action, you double the range of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">intimidating mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">for one minute (10 rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Increase the range to 20 feet, and you can use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">menacing mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">twice before needing to finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Mask Of Authority</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Your friends believe themselves better knowing you are around. All allies that can see and hear you can re -roll all 1s on their damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Personification of Authority (boost): </strong>Use an action, and for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.&nbsp;<br><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Allies re-roll all 1s and 2s on damage rolls; </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">personification of authority </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">improves to a +3 bonus to damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stand As One</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">As long as you stand, no one falls. All allies that can see and hear you reduce all damage inflicted on them by 1 (3 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Brotherhood (boost): </strong>As an action, you advise your allies on the best way to avoid damage. Select an energy type (acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder)—for one minute (10&nbsp;<br>rounds), all allies that can see you gain resistance to that energy type.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: All allies in range reduce all damage inflicted on them by 2 (6 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Strategic Precision</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You lead the attack, drawing allied fire to your target. If you hit a creature, pick one ally that can see or hear you—the targeted ally gains a +2 bonus to her next attack roll.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Strategic Superiority (boost): </strong>As an action, you convey an attack plan—for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the last target you hit until the beginning of your next turn. Your selected ally still only gains a +2 bonus.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Instead of a +2 bonus, the selected ally gains advantage.<br></span></p>\n<h2>FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, as an action, you can allow one ally within line of sight to take any action normally available to her as a reaction to you or as an additional action on her next turn. Additionally, you can swap your initia</span>tive order with another ally once per round.</p>\n<h2>Team Power</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and every fourth level after, you can select one </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">team power</span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. Several powers are only available to choose after level 5.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Autocratic</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an ally suffers a critical hit from a creature, you can use your reaction to give another ally a single attack against the creature that inflicted the critical hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Big Picture</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As an action, select one ally able to see and hear you. If the ally hits with an attack before the beginning of your next turn, that hit gains a damage bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Boar’s Head</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Spend 10 feet of movement to give an ally a 5-foot bonus to her speed until the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">boar’s head </span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">multiple times on your turn, but each ally cannot gain more than 5 feet of movement this way.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Control The Battle Theatre</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When rolling for initiative, you and each ally that can see or hear you has advantage on his or her initiative roll.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Face Slap</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5) Use an action to wake up one adjacent unconscious creature. If the target was unconscious from being reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she is healed to 1 hit point. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Focus Target</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a bonus action, you can grant an ally within 5 feet of you a single ranged attack against the same creature you hit with a ranged attack this same turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Improvisation Is The Best Plan</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Use a bonus action to gain 1 additional reaction before the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mark Of The Puppeteer</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Any time an ally hits with an attack, you can use a reaction to shove that creature 5 feet as long as the target is not moved into hazardous terrain (like fire or a pit).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>No One Hits The Chief</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature hits you with a critical hit, all allies that can see or hear you have advantage on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn against the creature that scored the hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pat On The Back</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When the party takes a short rest, you can award any of your Hit Dice to an ally. Allies cannot have more Hit Dice than their level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Plan of Attack</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can spend 10 feet of movement to move another ally 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pure Leader</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you hit an enemy with a ranged attack, you can inflict half damage and one ally can disengage from the same enemy and move up to half his speed.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Quick Patch</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use your action to administer aid to an ally—the target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6 / your level. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short or long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can select this trait multiple times, increasing the damage cured by 1d6 each time and gaining an additional use of quick patch between long rests.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Reading Body Language</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight), Wisdom (Survival), Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) checks (select one). You can select this trait multiple times, selecting a different skill each time.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Snap Out Of It</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an ally within 5 feet of you is charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can use your reaction to inflict 2d4 damage on that ally and remove the effect.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Unnecessary Abuse</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p>(Level 5)&nbsp;<span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an ally within 5 feet of you misses on an attack roll, you can use your reaction to inflict 1d4 damage on that ally and have them re-roll.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">ARCHETYPE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you choose an archetype.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest.

Perhaps you have a natural talent for leadership despite being a soldier like the rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You have the same battle training as a front-line fighter, can use all the same weapons, but generally will favor lighter arms and armor for greater maneuverability, flexibility and visibility to the team. In a pinch, the ability to convey orders with hand signals and facial expressions may mean life or death. A marshal must also be persuasive, and above all, brave, for nobody is going to risk life or limb for a coward.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are considered the leader in most parties. It will be assumed by outsiders, even if the assumption is inaccurate. You coordinate other members of the party, plots out strategies before a battle, and alters them tactically as the need arrives.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PLAYING A MARSHAL<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #242021; font-size: 16pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your personality will greatly affect your decision whether or not to select a marshal class, and if so, how you play one. A marshal is generally assumed to lead a party, so if you are not, the question is why. You, not just your marshal character, have to exhibit at least some compelling traits, a reason why those under your command would continue to follow you. In strict military channels, discipline can be enforced. Regardless, the other players should want to follow your instructions. You should know what you are talking about. So when creating a marshal, be aware that at points during the game, other players will be consulting you, asking for instructions, and seeking advice. If the sniper is in charge of the group instead of you, the GM may inquire as to the reason. This is not saying that the most charismatic personality in the party must select the marshal class, but some justification should be established as to why the marshal is not commanding the party.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Perhaps you are an introverted genius—able to enact brilliant tactical decisions when required but unable to carry a casual conversation. You must acknowledge your capacity as a person when selecting the marshal. Don’t assume the GM will hand you the reigns of a party just because you select this class.<br></span></p>\n<h2>CLASS FEATURES<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:

style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, your words and actions generate a presence that can motivate or generally boost those you deem your allies. Each command presence can also be temporarily boosted, after which you cannot boost it again until you finish a long rest.

Allies that can see and hear you have advantage on Constitution, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Exemplary Example (boost)</strong>: As an action, for the next minute (10 rounds), all allies gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Allies also gain advantage on Intelligence and Strength saving throws as well; the bonus from </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">exemplary example </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">increases to +2.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>FIELD ADVICE</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Using only your words, you call your comrades back from the most harmful of afflictions. Allies that can see and hear you double any effect that removes fatigue. Finishing a long rest reduces an ally’s fatigue level by 2, provided that the ally has also ingested some food and drink.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Profound Advice (boost): </strong>Use an action to give a rousing speech, and all allies that can see and hear you suppress all effects of fatigue for one hour.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: You gain a number of Hit Dice equal to your level that you can distribute to allies that can see and hear you when you and they finish a long rest. These additional Hit Dice must be used immediately or are lost. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, when you use </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">profound advice</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, each ally recovers hit points equal to a quarter of your current hit points.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Intimidating Mug</strong></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Opponents take one look at you and begin to rethink their approach. All enemies within 10 feet of you treat the area as difficult terrain.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Menacing Mug (boost)</strong>: As an action, you double the range of </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">intimidating mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">for one minute (10 rounds).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Increase the range to 20 feet, and you can use </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">menacing mug </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">twice before needing to finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Mask Of Authority</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Your friends believe themselves better knowing you are around. All allies that can see and hear you can re -roll all 1s on their damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Personification of Authority (boost): </strong>Use an action, and for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.&nbsp;<br><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Allies re-roll all 1s and 2s on damage rolls; </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">personification of authority </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">improves to a +3 bonus to damage rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stand As One</strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">As long as you stand, no one falls. All allies that can see and hear you reduce all damage inflicted on them by 1 (3 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Brotherhood (boost): </strong>As an action, you advise your allies on the best way to avoid damage. Select an energy type (acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder)—for one minute (10&nbsp;<br>rounds), all allies that can see you gain resistance to that energy type.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: All allies in range reduce all damage inflicted on them by 2 (6 at 10</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Strategic Precision</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You lead the attack, drawing allied fire to your target. If you hit a creature, pick one ally that can see or hear you—the targeted ally gains a +2 bonus to her next attack roll.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Strategic Superiority (boost): </strong>As an action, you convey an attack plan—for one minute (10 rounds), all allies that can see and hear you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the last target you hit until the beginning of your next turn. Your selected ally still only gains a +2 bonus.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Instead of a +2 bonus, the selected ally gains advantage.<br></span></p>\n<h2>FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, as an action, you can allow one ally within line of sight to take any action normally available to her as a reaction to you or as an additional action on her next turn. Additionally, you can swap your initia</span>tive order with another ally once per round.</p>\n<h2>Team Power</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and every fourth level after, you can select one </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">team power</span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">. Several powers are only available to choose after level 5.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Autocratic</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an ally suffers a critical hit from a creature, you can use your reaction to give another ally a single attack against the creature that inflicted the critical hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Big Picture</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As an action, select one ally able to see and hear you. If the ally hits with an attack before the beginning of your next turn, that hit gains a damage bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier + your level.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Boar’s Head</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Spend 10 feet of movement to give an ally a 5-foot bonus to her speed until the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">boar’s head </span></em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">multiple times on your turn, but each ally cannot gain more than 5 feet of movement this way.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Control The Battle Theatre</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When rolling for initiative, you and each ally that can see or hear you has advantage on his or her initiative roll.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Face Slap</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5) Use an action to wake up one adjacent unconscious creature. If the target was unconscious from being reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she is healed to 1 hit point. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Focus Target</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As a bonus action, you can grant an ally within 5 feet of you a single ranged attack against the same creature you hit with a ranged attack this same turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Improvisation Is The Best Plan</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Use a bonus action to gain 1 additional reaction before the beginning of your next turn.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mark Of The Puppeteer</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Any time an ally hits with an attack, you can use a reaction to shove that creature 5 feet as long as the target is not moved into hazardous terrain (like fire or a pit).<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>No One Hits The Chief</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">(Level 5)&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If a creature hits you with a critical hit, all allies that can see or hear you have advantage on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn against the creature that scored the hit.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pat On The Back</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When the party takes a short rest, you can award any of your Hit Dice to an ally.

This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pure Leader</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you hit an enemy with a ranged attack, you can inflict half damage and one ally can disengage from the same enemy and move up to half his speed.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Quick Patch</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can use your action to administer aid to an ally—the target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6 / your level. When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short or long rest. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can select this trait multiple times, increasing the damage cured by 1d6 each time and gaining an additional use of quick patch between long rests.<br></span></p>\n<h3><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Reading Body Language</strong><br></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight), Wisdom (Survival), Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) checks (select one).
