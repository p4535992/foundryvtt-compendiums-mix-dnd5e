Not only are you required to be proficient in Intelligence (Engineering), but you also must possess the appropriate Engineering kit. If so, then you can expend 5uc in widgets each day until you reach the market value of the item (this is called a build schedule). You must have widgets or parts on hand. Alternately, you can attempt to make an Intelligence (Engineering) checkâ€”the result is how much in uc you progress instead of taking the normal 5uc each day. This value can increase with the use of engineering kits.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #242021;\"><br>The tech level of your engineering kit affects the speed of your build, being a multiplier affecting the number of uc you can invest per day of use.
