The poison is introduced unknowingly, and slowly chips away at the victim's vitality, always threatening a slow and painful death. The promise of a cure is enough to make most people do things that they would otherwise avoid. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw vs poison or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 8 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can&rsquo;t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally, and only a greater restoration spell can end this poison outside of the cure or making the successful saving throws. The cure can be made by harvesting the toadstool&rsquo;s spores and combining these with alcohol that is then exposed to at least 15 points of radiant damage, which is enough to mutate the poisonous compounds in the spores.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Broderick's Compendium: Plants and Fungi Across the Realm (version 2.0)","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"veryRare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDestroy":false},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"potion"},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"value":null},"critDamage":{"value":""},"quickDesc":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickProperties":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickOther":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickFlavor":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"value":{"quantity":false},"altValue":{"quantity":false}}}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"1NiTbxriMZircYXv"}

The berries are slightly sweet and quite tasty, but have a strong effect on mammals: those who eat them fall asleep. The berries have this effect on mammals only (with half effects on half-mammals like half-elves and the like), but a single berry is enough to bring down any man sized or smaller mammal, and given enough berries, even the greatest mammal will fall asleep.

Although the berries can simply be eaten to cause the effect, it is also possible to dry them carefully and grind them into powder.

During the fight the avatar of Shar was wounded, and where her drops of her blood fell upon several saplings, they were forever changed. It has been noted that the trees were once found more commonly in places where the Shadow Weave was most prominent. The wood is soft and flexible when first cut, but hardens over the course of several days, allowing craftsmen to work easily on freshly cut wood to easily create ornate pieces. Once hardened, the wood retains the shape it was crafted into. The wood is often used to create furniture such as elaborately carved chairs, tables, and desks. Additionally, the wood is used to crat intricately detailed scepters, wands, and staves, and a wooden weapon made of Twilight Birch is said to do extra damage to celestials (+3 force damage to successful against celestials). In addition, when a magical item is crafted using Twilight Birch, and used to cast a Death or Trickery Domain spell (even if used by non-Clerics), it allows the spell to be cast one level higher without using a higher-level spell slot.
