      "value": "<p>This suite of programs contains a subset of holographic displays. A full suite has 20 displays. A used program is usually missing 1d20 âˆ’ 1 displays.</p>\n<p>The creator of this program, a human hacker, known as Gahri Gi'gax, wrote a randomization algorithm into its use. You can use an action to activate a display at random from the program, spawning a holographic image within 12m of you.</p>\n<p>The image of one or more creatures forms over the targeted area and remains until dispelled. The holographic creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 50m of the hologram and can see it, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 12m of the initial location. Any physical interaction with the hologram reveals it to be an illusion because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as a hologram with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>\n<p>The hologram lasts 1 hour or until you cancel the display. At which point, the display removes itself from the suite. Once you have used all of the displays, the program deletes itself from your omni-tool.</p>\n<p><em>Requires installation.</em></p>\n<p>[Refer to Programs in Player's Handbook]</p>",
