      "value": "<p>Conventional wisdom in combat is to avoid being targeted. You prefer an alternate school of thought, keeping enemies focused on you and off of your less stalwart allies.</p>\n<p>Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can make a feint to draw enemy attention. This feint may be a war cry, a loud insult, or a different distraction. All enemies within 16 meters must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a successful saving throw, a target is unaffected and is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. On a failed saving throw, an enemy has disadvantage on attacking any creature except you for the next minute, or until they make an attack against you. You may use this ability once per short or long rest.</p>",
