Many of them grew angry as they saw their book not getting picked up. It was the grand curator's job to trap those souls so that they do not bother the library's visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Use, 1/week: </strong>Often used in the dark, its azure light is capable of revealing any invisible creature and object.</p>\n<p><em>The grand curator, sees all.</em></p>",
