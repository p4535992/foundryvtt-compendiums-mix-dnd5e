The instrument&rsquo;s magic lasts for 1 hour. If the songends before the full duration is up, you can use an action torestart it. You can stop playing at any time. The music ends ifyou are incapacitated. Every creature of your choice within 120 ft. of you that can hear the song must succeed on a&nbsp;<strong>DC15 Wisdom saving throw</strong>&nbsp;or be charmed until the music endsor they can no longer hear it.</p>\n<p>While under the influence of the song's charm, a target isincapacitated. If the charmed target is more than 5 ft. awayfrom you, it must spend its turn moving towards you by themost direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, butbefore moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit,and whenever it takes damage from a source other than you, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can alsorepeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If acreature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p>\n<p>A target that successfully saves is immune to the song forthe rest of its duration. You can&rsquo;t use the concertina in this manner again until thenext dawn.</p>\n<p>@Macro[OJS745ECi8H47mNG]{MUSIC: Play Lost Whaler's Love by Music d20}</p>",
