      "value": "<p>The harbingers of death used the sickle's might to harvest and shred into your body's deepest crux. Whoever is slain through the sickle's doing is forced to leave the body. When one wields the Lantern of Imprisonment in combination with this sickle, one becomes a wielder of death who can banish souls into the lantern.</p>\n<p>The scythe once belonged to François Terriau who used it to command the dead. Contrary to what many believe about necromancers, he never used it for evil purposes. This scythe has been passed along from one head of the family to the next for hundreds of years. It was lost when François was slain but the truth is that he carried it with him</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> Two-handed melee attack with a reach of 10 ft. for 2d6 slashing damage + 4 necrotic damage.</p>\n<p>If a creature within 30 feet of the wielder dies and its soul is trapped somewhere (such as the Lantern of Imprisonment) then the wielder of the scythe can torture the soul to find its deepest secrets. Skilled fate-weaver necromancers can even command the souls of the ones killed by the scythe.</p>",
