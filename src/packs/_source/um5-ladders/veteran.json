      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You are grizzled and seasoned. You have become hardened to the traumas of the world through practical experience. Wisdom is your primary attribute with Charisma not far behind.</span> </p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">VETERAN</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Beyond any strength you may have in muscle or willpower, your survival through life could still be counted as luck. Your instincts have proven to be your greatest ally. You never ignore the lessons&nbsp; learned when events in your life turn desperate. You have seen or read enough to gauge where to be and when, what to say and how to say it. It isn't as much about avoiding injury as it is avoiding the escalation of a disagreement. You can see the symptoms of conflict before most others. You impart advice when needed; act first when events are unavoidable. You may not be the leader but you're certainly the one everyone turns to for advice. You may not know all the answers, but most everyone trusts your gut over what a computer might say. When situations are at their worst, you're at your best, staying cool and calm while others flee. You don't have to be grizzled and old to be wise. The world has a tendency to not care how old you are when it puts you through hell. In your spare time, you reminisce.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Charisma, Wisdom<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">CALM REFLEXES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can use Wisdom for all attack and damage rolls with ranged attacks, unarmed attacks and attacks with melee weapons without the heavy property.

You are also able to more easily overcome foes if you have dealt with them (or something similar) previously. If you fight a similar foe in the future, you have advantage on attack rolls until the first time you hit, and your first hit is also a critical hit. 'Similar' is defined as having the same basic creature stat block (with allowances for minor customizations the GM may have made to a particular creature): for instance, if you previously defeated a space gnome security guard, you would have a bonus against other space gnome security guards, but not against space gnome</span>&nbsp; mercenaries or space elf security guards.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">LADDER GAINS<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The veteran gains the following additional benefits at 5</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, and 17</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level:<br><strong>5</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC<br><strong>11</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.<br><strong>17</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: Your bonus to AC increases to +2.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
