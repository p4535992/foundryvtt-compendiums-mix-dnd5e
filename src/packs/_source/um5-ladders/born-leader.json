      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You possess a genuine charisma, always taking center stage. People naturally gravitate towards you. As result, Charisma is your primary ability with Intelligence as your secondary.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You have always displayed confidence in the way you talk and present yourself. You were the captain of a sports team, the head of a technical department, the supervisor for a menial commission retail job, or the squad commander in an army. You could also have been a used car salesman or actor. You don't even need to be all that physically attractive; you simply project a presence that encourages followers. Thankfully, beyond the simple aura of your charisma, you're also clever enough to know what to say at the right times to have the greatest effect. You know that how you speak means more than the words themselves. Even if you're not the leader of the group, you often do most of the talking when the need arrives. In your spare time, you socialize with others.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Charisma, Intelligence</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">BRAINS AND GOOD LOOKS</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1st level, you can always choose to use Intelligence instead of Wisdom for the Insight and Perception skills.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, after taking a long rest, if you wear no armor and wield no weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma or Intelligence (select one) until you make an attack roll or cast a spell. Select either Charisma or Intelligence as your primary born leader ability.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">COMPELLING DIRECTIVE</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 4</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary born leader ability, which has a maximum value of 22.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, after you finish a long rest, roll a d20 and put the result aside. You can swap out any roll you or an ally that can communicate with you makes for that result. You should always have a d20 result put aside this way, but after swapping two die rolls, you cannot swap another until you finish a short or long rest. After you finish a long rest, you always roll a new d20.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">SOCIAL SCIENCES</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 8</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1.

Additionally, you are able to turn a short rest into a long rest without an extension of time. This affects you and all allies you can see. After you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you have completed three additional long rests.</span></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">JUST STOP<br></span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 19</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Additionally, you are able to take a moment to focus and gather your wits, as well as the wits of your allies. Use an action, and you and all allies able to communicate with you gain the benefit of a short rest. This takes no time other than the action on your turn. After you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</span> </span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">LADDER GAINS</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The born leader gains the following additional benefits at 5</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, and 17</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level:<br><strong>5</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus to any Charisma or Intelligence skill of your choice.<br><strong>11</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br><strong>17</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"></span></p>",
