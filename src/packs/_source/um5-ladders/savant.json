      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You are compelled know as much as your brain can comprehend. You enjoy reading, understanding, and resolving problems. Intelligence is an automatic priority but smarts is useless without Wisdom.</span></p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">SAVANT</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your strengths are not in your endurance, speed, or ability to shoot something with pinpoint accuracy. You use a part of the body most of your comrades seem to let necrotize, your brain. You're the one with all the answers, an encyclopedia of knowledge. You went to school; you have degrees and awards of merit. You took those credentials and either went underground to use your expertise in nefarious ways or accepted a position with a school or corporation where they rained you with stock options and complimentary cars. You understand that you may be on the border between genius&nbsp; and madness, but all the great minds of the world balance that knife-edge. In your spare time, you read.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Intelligence, Wisdom<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TRAINING BEATS EXPERIENCE<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1st level, you can use Intelligence in place of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with one-handed and two-handed small arms. You can also use Intelligence or Wisdom as your modifier to AC instead of Dexterity, and as your spellcasting ability (if you cast spells). Select either Intelligence or Wisdom as your primary savant ability.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">NOT STUPID<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">At 4</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary savant ability, which has a maximum value of 22.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Additionally, you gain the insight to discover if something is simply... stupid. You can ask the GM if a course of action (either yours or an ally's you know about) is just plain dumb, or the GM can volunteer this information. If the action is borderline, the GM's answer may be cryptic, otherwise it should be straightforward. You can ask as many times as your primary savant ability modifier before you finish a long rest.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TRAINING BEATS EXPERIENCE<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">At 8</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary savant ability, which has a maximum value of 22.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Additionally, you also are proficient in all skills of your primary savant ability (if not already) and use your primary savant ability instead of Dexterity for your bonus to initiative.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">TOOOO SMART<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">At 12</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary savant ability, which has a maximum value of 22.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Also, if you use any skill tied to your primary savant ability to practice a profession during downtime activities, you can maintain a Wealthy lifestyle without having to pay per day. You also do not have to pay for research, and training costs 1/4 the usual time and money.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">EIDETIC MEMORY<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 16</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary savant ability, which has a maximum value of 22.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, if you have advantage on any roll (including attack rolls and saving throws) and both results would succeed, you can set one aside. At any point in the next five minutes, you can choose not to make a d20 roll and instead use the saved die. You can only set aside one result at a time, and if not used within 5 minutes, it is lost.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">OPUS<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 19</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary savant ability, which has a maximum value of 22.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Additionally, anytime you roll an ability check, skill check, or saving throw with your primary savant ability, you can set your die roll to your primary savant ability score.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">LADDER GAINS<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The savant gains the following additional benefits at 5</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, and 17</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level:<br /><strong>5</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br /><strong>11</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: You are immune to being charmed.<br /><strong>17</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Level</strong>: You are immune to being frightened.</span> <br style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />&nbsp;</p>",
