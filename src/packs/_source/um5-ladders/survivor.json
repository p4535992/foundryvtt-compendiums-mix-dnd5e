Constitution is your primary ability with Wisdom a close second.</span> </p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">SURVIVOR</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Regardless of how you have lived or where you were raised, you have always found a kinship with nature. You find salvation where others find death. While others starve, you prosper. No matter the environment, from bitter cold to scorching heat, you know the secrets to best stay alive. You can identify which foods will kill you or which animals will attack you. This is not knowledge gleaned from books but practical experience you may have earned the hard way. You may embark on weekend expeditions in the wilderness or elect to spend your entire life isolated from industry and population. You refuse to depend on technology. If the world were to fall into ruin, you would still survive. In your spare time, you prepare yourself for the next day.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Constitution, Wisdom<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">HUNTER<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can use Wisdom in place of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with ranged attacks.
