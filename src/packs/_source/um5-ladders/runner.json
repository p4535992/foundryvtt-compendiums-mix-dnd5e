      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You are healthy, lithe, and fast. Your mind and body are one as you focus your energy into evasion and pursuit. Dexterity is the obvious primary, but Intelligence or Wisdom are important secondary abilities.</span> </p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">RUNNER</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">With unmatched physical discipline, you have perfected a body designed for raw speed and agility. You are not a born soldier. If you served time in the military, your talents were as a scout, lightly armored and light on your feet. You may have grown up with an eye for sports. You broke records in the dash and ran for hours in marathons while others fell exhausted by the roadside. This was still not enough and you soon began finding more challenging ways to get from point A to point B.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Climbing walls, jumping across roofs, sliding under cars--nothing stood in your way. It’s not enough just to be athletic: you have to keep your eyes and mind sharp, to gauge distances, crawlspaces, and the shortest possible route even if it involves some death-defying feat of acrobatic skill. You can keep an entire landscape in mind, analyzing paths and routes of escape, even when everyone else just sees walls. This may not be raw brainpower but a natural instinct of the surrounding environment. In your spare time, you run.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Dexterity, Intelligence<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1st level, you can always choose to use Dexterity instead of Strength for the Athletics skill, and Intelligence instead of Wisdom for the Perception skill. You can also use Dexterity in place of Strength for attack or damage rolls with all weapons without the heavy property, and you have proficiency with Dexterity (Acrobatics). Select either Dexterity or Intelligence as your primary runner ability.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">CAT BALANCE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">At 4</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary runner ability, which has a maximum value of 22. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Additionally, your speed also increases by +5 feet.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Additionally, if you move at least 10 feet while moving towards a wall, your remaining movement becomes a climb speed until the end of your turn. This movement can be any direction as long as it follows a vertical surface.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">SAUTÉ DE PRECISION<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">At 8</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1.

You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary runner ability, which has a maximum value of 22. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, as an action, you can set your next Dexterity check or saving throw to your Dexterity score without rolling. You can do this as many times as your Intelligence modifier, and regain all spent uses after you finish a long rest.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, you also don’t suffer half damage from an effect that inflicts half damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ALL ABOUT THE FLIPPING<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 16</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary runner ability, which has a maximum value of 22. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, when wearing medium armor, your max Dex modifier is increased to 3. If wearing light armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Also, if you take an action to analyze your path before making any movement on your turn, until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">PARKOUR MASTER<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">At 19</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary runner ability, which has a maximum value of 22.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, you gain a pool of additional actions equal to your primary runner ability modifier. You can only use one additional action per turn, and only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Use an Object actions. Your action pool refills when you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">LADDER GAINS</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The runner gains the following additional benefits at 5</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, and 17</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level:<br><strong>5</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: You gain a +1 bonus to AC when not wearing heavy or exo-armor.<br><strong>11</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: Your bonus to AC increases to +2<br><strong>17</strong></span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Level</strong>: Your bonus to AC increases to +3.</span></p>",
