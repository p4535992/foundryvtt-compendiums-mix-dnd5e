      "value": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You're a fighter in any situation, whether that is in a ring, in an alley, or in a warzone. You can wield a blade, a bow, a pistol, or a tank. Sometimes all you need are your fists. Dexterity and Strength are both vital.</span></p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">WARRIOR<br></span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Your life is defined by your path, not how you walk it. You have trained from an early age by choice or by inheritance to take the role of a combatant. Your natural gifts were discovered and focused into a lifelong dedication. This is not to assume you're a warmonger, as such training comes with the responsibility to know restraint. For many, having the skills is a means for self-discovery. This can apply in the application of hand-to-hand combat, the use of melee weapons, or in the proficiency of small-arms. You might have lived on a farm, on a military base, or in a temple. You might have devoted your life to the implement of one craft or to the broad use of many. Your power comes from commitment. Your victory is due to training. A true warrior knows when to fight and what to learn when a defeat occurs. In your spare time, you meditate and contemplate.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><strong>Key Abilities</strong>: Dexterity, Strength<br></span></p>\n<h2>STRENGTH OVER AGILITY</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Beginning when you choose this ladder at 1</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">st </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can use Strength in place of Dexterity for all attack and damage rolls when wielding two-handed small arms, heavy weapons, or super heavy weapons. When wearing medium armor, your max Dex modifier is increased to 3. When wearing heavy armor, you gain a max Dex bonus of 1. Select either Strength or Dexterity as your warrior ability.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">POWER UP<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">At 4</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature except for your primary warrior ability, which has a maximum value of 22.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Additionally, you can power up as an action. You gain a power rank, starting at 1 and increasing to a maximum of 5 with successive power ups. Each rank has an associated power up ability which you can choose to apply to one attack (each ability also includes all lower ranks). You lose your power ranks when you use the ability, or when you roll for initiative, suffer any damage, or finish a short or long rest.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Power Rank 1</strong>: You have advantage on your next attack; if you hit, the damage die of any weapon you wield increases by one step (1d4 &gt; 1d6 &gt; 1d8 &gt; 1d10 &gt; 1d12).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Power Rank 2</strong>: Regardless of your next attack roll, it automatically hits; the damage die of any weapon you wield increases by an additional step.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Power Rank 3</strong>: Regardless of your attack roll, your next attack is a critical hit.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Power Rank 4</strong>: Re-roll all 1s and 2s on your damage dice of your next hit. Each time you roll the maximum result on a damage die, roll that die again and add the result to your damage. If you roll the maximum result on a reroll, keep rolling and adding until you get a different result.'<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Power Rank 5</strong>: With your next hit, double all damage dice—this stacks with your critical hit.<br></span></p>\n<h2>ULTRA SUPER<span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 8</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You can also spend 1 Hit Die as a reaction to suffering<br>damage—you regain no hit points but you do not lose your current power rank.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">CONVERT ENERGY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 12</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
