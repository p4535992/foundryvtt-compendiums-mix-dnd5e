      "value": "<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">BANNER HEAD<br></span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You are not a pretty individual. You are not one for arts and crafts. You have no hobbies. You have one job. You shoot people twice in the chest and once in the head. You do it for no other reason than the objective you have been asked to carry out. Your loyalty runs only to the men and women next to you. To them, you’re the champion hero. To your foes, you are the one target they need to take down. You want them to think that. What good is war if there is no one to shoot at?<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">SYNERGY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This archetype works best with the grounder, gunslinger, heavy, and marshal classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">PROFICIENCIES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You gain proficiency in any two ranged weapons of your choice.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">FLEETING ADVERSARY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, select one creature within 50 feet and line of sight to you after rolling initiative. The target is your fleeting adversary. You gain a +1 bonus to attack your fleeting adversary, and your fleeting adversary suffers disadvantage on attack rolls that don’t not include you as a target. This effect ends if you drop to 0 hit points, the creature drops to 0 hit points, you move beyond 50 feet, or line of sight is broken between you and your target. Once you select a fleeting adversary, you cannot select another until you roll for initiative again.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">THE WAR POSE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 7</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can take a -1 penalty to attack rolls for each weapon you wield to wield a two-handed small arm with one hand. The weapon only counts as a one-handed small arms for purposes of how many hands you use to wield it, and for abilities and feats.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ADVERSARIAL RAGE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you deal +2 damage against your fleeting adversary (+4 at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, +8 at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level): this bonus ends if the target is no longer your fleeting adversary. Once you use this feature, you cannot select another until you finish a long rest.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">REMEMBER ME?<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, a few well-placed shots can bring an enemy’s attention back around to you. If your fleeting adversary attacks an ally, you can&nbsp; make a single ranged attack against it as a reaction.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">UNEXPECTED RESPONSE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, level, until your fleeting adversary is reduced to 0 hit points, each time it hits you, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against it. This bonus is cumulative up to +3 but is lost if you attack any creature other than your fleeting adversary or you score a hit.</span></p>",
