You may never have taken a bullet but likely neither has your target. You can spot threats from miles away and can act to move your ward</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">to a better position if that threat gets too close.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">SYNERGY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This archetype works best with the face, grounder, heavy, and martial artist classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TAKE A BULLET<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can select one creature within 5 feet of you to be your focus. As long your focus remains in reach of you, he can use your AC if it is higher than his. If your focus is hit by an attack or fails a Dexterity saving throw, you can take any damage and/or effects instead. When you move, you can pull your focus with you. Once you select your focus, you cannot select another until after your take a short rest. If your focus moves out of reach, it no longer benefits from </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">selfless protector </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">until he or you returns.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">LICENSED RESPONSE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 7</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, if your focus is hit with an attack, regardless if it suffers any damage, you can make an attack against the attacker as a reaction. If your focus suffers damage, you have advantage with this attack.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">JOB WELL DONE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, as long as you are actively protecting your focus, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, when you take a short rest, if you previously selected focus had suffered no damage, you regain double your Hit Dice.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">EVASIVE TECHNIQUES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, if your focus is within reach and is caught by an area effect, as a reaction, you throw your focus up to 15 feet away before the effect activates.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">KEEP IT TOGETHER<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, each time you regain hit points, you can give your focus any amount of the hit points instead.</span></p>",
