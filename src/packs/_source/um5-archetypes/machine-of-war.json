This may be true but the fact is that there will always be a war somewhere. Your nation or your pocket-book will always be threatened. You have found a niche and fill it well. You may even acknowledge that this journey is only taken on by someone psychotic. Most heroes are insane anyway. At least you're aware of how close you are to losing it. If there was no war, you would be the type picking fights in bars, eventually committing suicide with the very weapon you used to&nbsp;<br>dispatch your foes.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">It's a great time to be alive. In this world, there is always a war, always an evil, always an opponent. You spend your life hunting and destroying monsters that obsess over leaving a scar upon planet and people as proof they existed. Medals are for the weak. All you require is a reliable weapon, an enemy, and finger to point the way. Morality and motivation are only convenient crutches you're happy to use when the need arises. You sometimes wonder if you're a good person or just thankfully on the right side. You take the actions you do as proof of your ethics. Save the innocent or kill the bad guy. Regardless of your response, your allies are thankful you're on their side.<br></span></p>\n<h2>SYNERGY<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">This archetype works best with the grounder, gunslinger, martial artist classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2>ADRENALINE RUSH<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">level, each time you make an attack against a creature within 30 feet of you, you regain 1 hit point of damage. For every ten hit points recovered this way, you gain one additional attack with your next Attack action.<br></span></p>\n<h2>GLAZED LOOK<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Starting at 7</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points by a non-critical hit, you automatically use and roll a Hit Die as a reaction, but only regain half the result (round up).</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">YOU WANT SOME OF THIS?<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can allow enemies to have advantage on you until the beginning of your next turn. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls and regain 2 hit points instead of 1 with </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Adrenaline Rush</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">RISKY MANEUVER<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, if you have less than 15 hit points, double your proficiency bonus on attack rolls.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ULTIMATE BADASS<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, when your hit points are reduced to half your total hit point value or less, you gain a bonus to damage equal to half your Constitution bonus. When your hit points are reduced to one-quarter your total hit value or less, this bonus increases to your full Constitution bonus.</span></p>",
