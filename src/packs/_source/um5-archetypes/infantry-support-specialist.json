You support those that have earned your loyalty. You are an infantry support specialist. You carry the largest weapons and know how to employ them effectively without endangering the lives of your&nbsp; allies.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Your only weakness is your speed. Being the heaviest hitter has also often made you the slowest. Your abilities are based upon lying down heavy fire and to prevent the approach of invading forces.<br></span></p>\n<h2>SYNERGY<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This archetype works best with the grounder, heavy, marshal, and techie classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PROFICIENCIES</h2>\n<p>You have proficiency with simple melee weapons, all small arms, heavy weapons, and super heavy weapons.</p>\n<h2>WEAPONS PLATFORM<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #242021;\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #242021;\">if you don’t move on your turn, you can plant your feet to stabilize your position. You cannot use your speed to move until the beginning of your next turn. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with auto or auto-heavy weapons. Saving throw DCs against your auto or auto-heavy weapon attacks also increase by 1.<br></span></p>\n<h2>FOCUSED BARRAGE</h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, if using an auto or auto-heavy weapon, at the end of your turn, you can make a single ranged attack against one target you have already hit that same turn.</p>\n<h2>LAWNMOWER BARRAGE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can move 5 feet without incurring attack penalties with two-handed small arms and heavy weapons (but not super heavy weapons). At 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can plant a super heavy weapon as a bonus action.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">THE MEAN ONE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, all opponents within 20 feet of you suffer disadvantage on any attack that doesn’t include you, and you gain a +5 bonus to damage rolls with ranged weapons against them.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">LET’S ROCK!<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">level, you can use an action to make a single ranged attack against each enemy in range you can see. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. If no targets are hit by this action, you regain the use of this feature.&nbsp;</span></p>",
