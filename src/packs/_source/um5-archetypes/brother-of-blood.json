      "value": "<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">BROTHER OF BLOOD<br></span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">On the battlefield, every ally is a brother. You are a member of a team and you’ve all worked together long enough to understand each other’s patterns. You know when one is hurt, regardless of where on the battlefield. You would never take risks that will endanger another brother’s life. You would never step out of formation; never leave a brother’s side. They must depend on you as you depend on them. If one of your own falls, nothing short of god’s finger on the battlefield will stop you from carrying your injured out of combat.<br></span></p>\n<h2>SYNERGY<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This archetype works best with the grounder, marshal, medic, and sniper classes.<br></span></p>\n<h2>PROFICIENCIES</h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You are proficient with one weapon and one armor (except exo-armor) another brother in blood is proficient in. If you both choose this archetype at the same time, you can both choose new items, as long as you</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"fontstyle0\">both choose the same items.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">MORE LIKE FAMILY<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, if a creature scores a critical hit on an allied brother of blood, you can make a single ranged attack against the attacker as a reaction.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">ALLIED SUPPORT<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 7</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can use a bonus action and target one allied brother of blood in line of sight. The targeted brother of blood gains an action that must be used before the end of your turn. This does not count as a reaction for the ally. Each brother of blood can benefit from Allied Support only once per round. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. You gain one additional use of Allied Support at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, and 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">ARMY OF TWO<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you grant a +3 bonus to damage rolls to each brother of blood within 10 feet of you (cumulative up to +6). Remember that they will be granting you this same bonus.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">BETTER REFLEXES<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, you can use the Help action on another allied brother of blood as a bonus action.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TEAM EFFORT<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">All members of the team synchronize their actions to operate as one organism. Starting at 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">level, after rolling for initiative, you and all allied brothers of blood act on the highest initiative among you. You all can decide which order you act in.</span></p>",
