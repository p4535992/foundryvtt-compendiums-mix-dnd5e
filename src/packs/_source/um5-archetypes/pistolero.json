      "value": "<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">PISTOLERO<br></span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You believe your abilities to be naturally canny skills developed over years of hard training and discipline. You possess the capacity to be in the right place at the right time in close combat to place a perfect shot. You prefer to present yourself in close quarters, preventing </span>enemies from striking from a distance. You maneuver to get close, maximizing your firing potential while reducing the capacity to be hit in return. It is not unheard to jump in the midst of an enemy squad, take every one down at point blank range, and walk away without a scratch.</p>\n<p>To do that, you must get close, study your targets, and make every shot count. You study a scene in seconds and know exactly where to stand and in what position to offer the greatest level of defense while making your weapons lethal with a single shot.</p>\n<h2>SYNERGY</h2>\n<p>This archetype works best with the gunslinger, medic, and techie classes.</p>\n<h2>PROFICIENCIES</h2>\n<p>You have proficiency with all one-handed small arms.</p>\n<h2>POINT SHOT<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Starting at 3</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">rd </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, as an action, you can make a single ranged attack with a non-auto one-handed small arm against a creature 20 feet or closer. You inflict an additional 1d6 damage on a hit, increasing this damage by one step at 7</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">, 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">, 15</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">, and 18</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level (1d6 &gt; 2d6 &gt; 3d6 &gt; 4d6 &gt; 5d6 &gt; 6d6 &gt; 7d6 &gt; 8d6 &gt; etc.). Any additional effects which increase damage this way, including other pistolero abilities, are compounded.<br></span></p>\n<h2>WEAVER STANCE<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"color: #242021;\">Starting at 7th level, you can wield a single one-handed small arm with two hands. If so, you suffer a 20-foot penalty to speed at the beginning of your turn that lasts until the beginning of your next turn; you also increase Point Shot damage by 1 step for that same time.<br></span></p>\n<h2>KILL SHOT<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Starting at 11</span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">level, you make sure each opponent is dead before moving on. If your Point Shot attack reduces a creature to fewer hit points than your level, as a bonus action, you use one additional round of ammunition to kill the target.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">KINETIC SHOT<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 15th level, if you act before an enemy after rolling initiative, you can increase your Point Shot damage against that enemy by two steps until the enemy acts.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ONLY NEED ONE<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starting at 18th level, if you score a critical hit with a Point Shot attack, increase your damage by two steps.</span></p>",
