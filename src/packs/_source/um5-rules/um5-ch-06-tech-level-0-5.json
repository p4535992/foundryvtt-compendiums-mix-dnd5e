Most items have a Tech Level (TL) of 0, meaning they have no considerable advantage over other items. Higher levels involve lasers, magnetics, powered armor, and plasma weapons, which are not available in most modern settings. Equipment is listed having a TL of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If an item doesn’t have an indicated TL, it is 0.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Modifications for Tech Level</strong>: If setting a game at TL1 or higher, the cost of gear at that level and all lower levels (except TL0) is reduced by 50%. While the cost of equipment of a higher TL than the campaign standard should not increase, the availability of such equipment should be strictly controlled. The assumed 'default' TL for most U5 games is TL2 (present daynear future). </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Cost</strong>: If setting a game at TL1 or higher, the cost of gear at that level and lower levels (except TL0) is<br>reduced by 50%.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">APPLICATION OF TECH LEVELS<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The tech level can affects the difficulty and cost of the<br>crafting, repairing and modifying of technology. It can<br>also affect its rarity.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 0 and TL 1: Common. All items with no listed TL are TL0.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 2: Uncommon<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 3: Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 4: Very Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 5: Legendary</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If setting a game at a higher TL, you can shift the rarity down to make items more common. Certain items (like exo-armor) may be rarer than their listed tech level. They may also count as multiple items. Tech levels can also apply in other ways depending on the device in question: see the item descriptions for details.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">TECH LEVEL 0<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.5Omv85vwf9Hu3YHJ]{UM5 Ch.6: Tech Level 0}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">This level covers the entirety of civilized history until the early industrial era, stopping before the harnessing of electric power: everything from the discovery of the wheel to its use in manufacturing.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Gliders or basic aero-forms. Both ground and aircraft are limited to archaic steam power. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weapons</strong>: All weapons rely on chemical propellant with simple loading mechanisms. The blunderbuss and musket are examples.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Medical</strong>: Natural healing. TL0 benefits more from rediscovered human knowledge about biology than the tools that were developed consequently. Surgery can cure most wounds, but recovery can last a while.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Similarity</strong>: Up to mid-18</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 6pt;\">th </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">century.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">TECH LEVEL 1<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.oaLjWnlYGoulu7oy]{UM5 Ch.6: Tech Level 1}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">At this level, machines come into their own. Internal combustion and steam power have been perfected. Electric power and road vehicles are changing the way cities are built.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Ground vehicles are run off internal combustion and basic electrical systems. The fact they are mass produced is the real achievement. Aircraft are flown by manual controls and receive propulsion from propellers.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weapons</strong>: Bolt action rifles and revolvers. Cartridge-fed firearms are becoming more common.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Medical</strong>: The implementation of the scientific method, and laboratory research has resulted in vaccines and the basics of genetic engineering.

Electrification is now commonplace, though computers have yet to dominate civilization.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Ground vehicles now sport electronics; some even have climate control and electronic stability. Aircraft now have fly-by-wire, vectored thrust and vertical-take-off capacity.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weapons</strong>: Computer tracking and targeting. Infrared and thermal imaging is available, but not standard. Firearms haven’t changed but have grown more complicated with advanced reloading and higher firing rates. Advances in construction make them lighter with larger calibers.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Medical</strong>: Computer diagnostic beds, MRIs, and XRays.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Similarity</strong>: Mid 20th century to the not too distant future.<br></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;\">TECH LEVEL 3<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.wbgddINY6cseqVgE]{UM5 Ch.6: Tech Level 3}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Refinements in the manipulation of magnetic fields and energy levels characterize this stage. Computers now control most of civilization and link all its citizens together.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Vertical take-off fan craft and wingless jets keep aircraft aloft, are much more stable, and can fly rings around more primitive craft. Aircraft designs are no longer dominated by their massive aero-forms. Ground vehicles still use wheels but now mass transit magnetic vehicles appear as an alternative.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weapons</strong>: There will always be bullets, but the rise of both railcannons and self-propelled projectiles offer alternatives. Laser weaponry in its infancy. Advanced magnetics.
