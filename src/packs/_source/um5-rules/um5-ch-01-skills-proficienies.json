Computer Use specifically covers more advanced concepts like hardware modification, upgrade, and maintenance. Computer Use is also employed in the researching of online materials. You can attempt the repair or modification of a computer, circumvent security, create programs, or use it to replace Intelligence (Investigation) when researching a subject.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>INTELLIGENCE (DEMOLITIONS)</h2>\n<p>If proficient in demolitions, you can set and disarm explosives. This includes the planting of all manners of mechanical and electronic detonators. A successful check lets you place explosives to best effect and set or disarm detonators. Failure means that the explosive fails to go off as planned. The explosives are not lost. Failure by 10 or more means the explosive might go off (if it is an explosive that can) as the detonator is being installed. A failure with wiring explosives together means the extra wired explosives will not go off with the primary (See Equipment).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">INTELLIGENCE (ENGINEERING)</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This is the broad skill dealing with all applications of technology, allowing you to craft, modify, and repair devices. These include electronics, general machines, exo-armor, techan armor, techan weapons, and vehicles. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color:#242021\"><strong>Crafting</strong>: Crafting technology deviates slightly from crafting mundane items. Not only are you required to be proficient in Intelligence (Engineering), but you also must possess the appropriate Engineering kit. If so, then you can expend 5uc in widgets each day until you reach the market value of the item (this is called a build schedule). You must have widgets or parts on hand. Alternately, you can attempt to make an Intelligence (Engineering) check—the result is how much in uc you progress instead of taking the normal 5uc each day. This value can increase with the use of engineering kits.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color:#242021\"><br />The tech level of your engineering kit affects the speed of your build, being a multiplier affecting the number of uc you can invest per day of use. A TL1 kit thus cannot affect your build time, while a TL5 kit allows you to spend 5 times more uc than normally for a day’s work. You cannot build other kits or medical injections. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color:#242021\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Disarm Electronic Locks</strong>: When attempting to disarm a trap or break through a lock using an Engineering tool kit, you can use Intelligence (Engineering) granted you have a tool kit of at least equal tech level of the device you are trying to affect.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /><strong>Recover Hit Points</strong>: You can take a day of downtime and make an Intelligence (Engineering) to recover the hit points of damaged items or vehicles. The number of hit points recovered is equal to the result of your skill check -10.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />This value can be adjusted with an appropriate engineering kit. If the kit is more advanced than the item<br />being repairs, add the difference to the hit points recovered. If the other way around, the recovered hit points<br />is reduced (if repairing a TL2 item with a TL4 kit, you gain a +2 bonus to the hit points recovered—if reversed,<br />it becomes a -2 penalty). The repair cost in widgets for each day is equal the number of hit points recovered x 5.<br />Reverse Engineer: You can use the Intelligence (Engineering) skill to convert technology into widgets to be used in the creation of other technology. Each attempt to reverse engineer an item takes six hours. Reverse engineering destroys the item being selected. The end result is you acquire one-fifth of the item’s value in widgets.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /><strong>Sabotage</strong>: You can use Intelligence (Engineering)</span>  <span class=\"fontstyle0\">skill to sabotage devices and vehicles. With this technique, you can inflict effects instantly or when certain conditions occur.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />You can only attempt sabotage against a target which you can incapacitate logically. The GM can refuse a sabotage attempt if you have no way of accessing vital components in the target. The GM may also require you to spend time gaining access to said components.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />There are hundreds of different effects you can accomplish with sabotage. Effects last until the effect is repaired unless stated otherwise. Effects can be repaired by a contested Intelligence (Engineering) check or with specific solutions to each problem (breaking open a door instead of fixing the sabotage).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">INTELLIGENCE (SCIENCES)</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This is the general study of the applications of the unaltered rules that govern the real world. It deals with broad studies like Biology, Astronomy, and Geography and into further specific fields of expertise like Biochemistry and Astrophysics. Given enough dedication, you could earn grants and degrees, specializing in a field of study to better your species and the natural world. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Being a top mind of the profession could enable you to unravel a genome or to design and build your own superconducting supercollider.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />You do not have to specify a field of expertise. This skill refers to a general knowledge of science. You use this skill for general scientific observations.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">VEHICLE PROFICIENCY</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If proficient with a vehicle, you know how to drive or pilot said vehicle and any situation. There are five types of vehicle proficiency—light ground, heavy ground, super-heavy ground, and aircraft, and watercraft. If possessing one, you know how to control all vehicles of that type. So if you ride one bike, you can ride them all. Although not entirely accurate given the broad range of technology seen across the world, this is a compromise to prevent clutter.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />Routine tasks such as ordinary driving don't require a check. You only make a check when experiencing unusual circumstances (such as stormy weather or a slippery surface), performing a stunt, driving at high speeds, or if trying to operate a vehicle while being attacked or attacking.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> <br />If you fail a Dexterity check with a vehicle, you must suffer the consequences. This can include a second change to recover, a slide, or a crash. Some stunts are easy, and they neither require a skill check nor have consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />If you are crashing, you often lose control of your vehicle and cannot perform any checks involving your</span>  <span class=\"fontstyle0\">vehicle until the crash is resolved. In most crashes, you continue your remaining movement in the direction you were previously pointed. In others (like catastrophic jumps), you immediately stop your movement.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />See<strong> Vehicle Rules</strong> in the <strong>Equipment </strong>chapter for detailed rules on vehicles and how they are controlled.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><em><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:11pt\">Vehicles used to be a skill, but I decided to make them an item proficiency. Although one would expect me to follow suite with medicine requiring a medical kit, but Wisdom (Medicine) has already been established</span> </strong></em></p>"
