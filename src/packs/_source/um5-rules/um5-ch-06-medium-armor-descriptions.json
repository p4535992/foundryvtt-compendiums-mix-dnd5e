Additional layers of nylon separate staggered sheets of thin polymer plastic. <br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Resistance (Mk2): </strong>You have resistance to fire and bludgeoning from nonmagical weapons.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Aramid Survival Suit<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This employs a combination of flexible aramid fabrics and rigid ceramic and metal plates. The suit covers the wearer completely, sealing her from the outside environment.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Mask</strong>: You are immune to gas attacks and inhaled poisons.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Resistances (Mk2): </strong>You have resistance to fire and cold, as well as bludgeoning from nonmagical weapons. <br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Blinder-Mail<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This resembles a lightened version of the heavier titanium carbide armor. What it offers in addition is a holographic camouflage net that can alter the physical properties of the suit to resemble nearly any terrain it is using.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Stealth</strong>: When you activate the stealth net, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can attempt to hide even without cover or breaking line of sight (although doing so negates your advantage). The stealth net takes one charge per minute of use.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Force Body Vest<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">An upgrade from basic ballistics armor, this variation is lighter, equally as resilient, and is offered in a modular configuration, making it far easier to provide a proper fit. If worn below clothes, it is still apparent.<br /></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Nanotech Combat Armor<br /></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This suit uses molecule-sized machines to alter the composition of the suit at the instant of impact. Usually, the combat suit remains elastic and comfortable. Anytime any impact occurs, the micromachines react with a response time of less than 0.035 seconds. The impact point becomes immediately inflexible and solid, deflecting the attack.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Nano-Reaction</strong>: Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Resistances</strong>: You have resistance to fire and cold, as well as bludgeoning and slashing from nonmagical weapons.</span></p>\n<p> </p>"
