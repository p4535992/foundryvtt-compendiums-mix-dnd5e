Archetypes are no longer bound to specific classes, meaning you can feasibly match any class to any archetype.&nbsp;<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">There are also classes that are not combat-basedâ€”their power is not in how much damage they inflict, but how they can alter the course of a story. The ten classes are as follows.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.Z0bZUsa9hFdJEZOx]{Face}<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You use words and a smile to succeed in areas where bullets would fail. Your abilities confound and seduce. Combine with the runner and know when to run when words fail. Combine with warrior so you can throw a punch under those same circumstances.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.bgC52F6T1bNSfgy8]{Gunslinger}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You wield pistols like they're an extension of your body. It could be one firearm or two. You can fire one bullet or unleash volleys. Pair this with runner and dash through combat like an action hero. Opt for veteran and be the stone-faced marshal of a classic western.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.LFV67Ix7MIBzt0hX]{Grounder}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You're the tried and trained soldier, able to use any weapon in any situation. Unlike the heavy class, you wield firearms against specific opponents, most likely the greatest threat on the battlefield. Select a born leader to be a front line leader that has earned authority through shared combat, or opt for warrior and be full time militant.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.rZjOghQpMW4Pfj2h]{Heavy}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You often wield the largest, most devastating weapons. Your powers involve raining down large area effects on&nbsp;<br>multiple opponents, hindering their movements and preventing them from gaining advantage. Pair this with juggernaut to create an unstoppable force of fire and thunder. Select veteran and be the largest gun that has survived the most battles.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.6U0e3NaMi4ruDynT]{Infiltrator}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You're an assassin trained to operate independently from others. You move in by stealth and inflict massive damage on single foes. You go about this using either a firearm or a blade. Select the survivor ladder and be the singular killer that journey's for weeks to dispatch your enemy. Select runner and make haste your escape after you succeed.</span></p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.g20jtqNyx2wSEfPT]{Marshal}</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You use strategy and tactics to control the battle theater. Your limit enemy movement, hindering their effectiveness. Inflicting damage comes via placing enemies in harm's way. You can pair this with born leader and affect both allies and enemies. Select veteran and be a trained commander of a unit. Be a warrior and stand on the front line with your brothers.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.8WfsQdIVhqgoH9QN]{Martial Artist}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You disdain the efficiency of firearms in favor of straight melee fighting. The martial artist covers nearly every style, whether it is using fists or swords. Although you would think a warrior would be the obvious choice, nearly every ladder has something to offer. Be a juggernaut to ram through opponents or be a savant to use your mind as well as your fists.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.nxNK2R7E5Ph6zoB4]{Sniper}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You don't offer yourself as a target. You take out enemies from as far away as possible. You target single opponents and inflict devastating conditions, a talent you can employ with every attack. Pair with survivor and be a guerilla or select savant and brandish your weapon openly while you surgically remove enemies from the battlefield.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.pA193z40luqAsv5m]{Medic}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You are a doctor, pure and simple. Because of the nature of the class and the game, you are encouraged to be a healer. Although a savant would be an obvious ladder, any combat-based ladder will supply some much needed offensive abilities.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-classes.5cjYFd2R3HDGbegU]{Techie}</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">You sabotage enemy technology while modifying your own to boost its performance. Abilities are based around improving the capacity of your weapon. Pair your class with warrior or juggernaut to be a combat engineer. Alternately, you could select savant and be a general geek </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\" style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">as well.</span></p>",
