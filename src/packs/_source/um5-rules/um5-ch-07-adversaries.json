Monsters from other&nbsp;sources may be turned into minions by reducing their&nbsp;AC by 1 and cutting their hit points to 1/4. Three minions count as one normal creature of the listed challenge rating.</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">ADVERSARIES</span></h1>\n<p>The creatures under this heading are generic, to allow&nbsp;for a wider range of enemies. To customize them, assign them one of the adversary traits below. For ease of&nbsp;bookkeeping, it is recommended that you use only one&nbsp;group of adversaries in a single encounter. Adversary&nbsp;traits should be given only to creatures in this section,&nbsp;not to the unique opponents later in this chapter or to&nbsp;creatures from other sources.</p>\n<p>Adversaries are listed in order of their challenge&nbsp;rating, not by their name.</p>\n<h1>ADVERSARY TRAITS</h1>\n<p>When building a battle involving common adversaries,&nbsp;choose one of the following special rules below.</p>\n<h2>Drone</h2>\n<p>Drones are usually robots or otherwise mindless automatons built or gathered in massive numbers, designed to overwhelm opponents in enormity rather&nbsp;than capabilities. Certain losses in combat are expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>More Than Expected</strong>. A drone has disadvantage&nbsp;on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving&nbsp;throws. When fielding creatures with the minion property, increase the number of minions to 4 instead of 3&nbsp;for each group of minions.</p>\n<h2>Fanatic</h2>\n<p>Fanatics believe absolutely in their chosen path. They&nbsp;will risk everything, including their lives, for the completion of the task they place before themselves. They&nbsp;are often, but not always, religious zealots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>For the Cause</strong>. A fanatic has advantage on Constitution and Wisdom saving throws and is immune to&nbsp;being frightened. In addition, when the fanatic is reduced to 0 hit points or less, all fanatics in line of sight&nbsp;may move up to 30 feet as a reaction.</p>\n<h2>Guerrilla</h2>\n<p>Guerillas avoid presenting themselves as a target.&nbsp;They are often underequipped and undermanned,&nbsp;offsetting that deficiency with stealth. They will prefer quick attacks and maneuverability over straight&nbsp;open gunplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Dirty Fighter</strong>. The guerilla has advantage with&nbsp;Dexterity (Stealth) checks. It also gains an additional&nbsp;+2 bonus to AC when benefiting from cover (+4 and +7&nbsp;respectfully). It also inflicts +2 extra damage when&nbsp;making ranged attacks from cover.</p>\n<h2>Hive</h2>\n<p>A hive shares one mind or has many minds synchronized to operate as one in the combat arena. Although&nbsp;technically possible with organic brains, this is seen&nbsp;almost exclusively with robots.</p>\n<p><strong>We Are One</strong>. Every hive unit knows the location of&nbsp;all other hive units. A member of a hive can sacrifice&nbsp;its action to give another hive advantage on one attack&nbsp;roll, ability check, or skill check on its turn (pick one).&nbsp;Hive adversaries cannot receive more than one benefit&nbsp;per round.</p>\n<h2>Ironclad</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, an opponent may not be particularly well&nbsp;trained but may be particularly well funded. They&nbsp;may have better weapons and better armor because of&nbsp;the economy of their government or because of their&nbsp;position in the army, despite deficiencies in other&nbsp;fields.</p>\n<p><strong>Tough Man</strong>. An ironclad gains resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing. It also gains +1 damage&nbsp;if any its damage dice roll the maximum result.</p>\n<h2>Mob</h2>\n<p>Mobs supply courage and strength through numbers.&nbsp;A mob is populated by underequipped, untrained individuals and must offset that by overwhelming their&nbsp;foes. They are often civilians.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Confidence</strong>. If mob creatures outnumber&nbsp;their opponents by 2-to-1 or more, each mob creature&nbsp;has advantage on attack rolls but cannot inflict a critical&nbsp;hit.</p>\n<h2>Regimented Unit</h2>\n<p>Regimented units work as a team and must deploy in&nbsp;numbers in an encounter to be effective. On their own, they are useless. Unlike a mob, however, these&nbsp;forces have undergone training to work together, and as&nbsp;such are not known for acts of stupidity, like breaking&nbsp;from a line.</p>\n<p><strong>Reliable Backup</strong>. The regimented unit gains a +2&nbsp;bonus to AC while within five feet of another allied&nbsp;regimented unit. In addition, if it moves, it can disengage one allied regimented unit within five feet and&nbsp;pull it up to 20 feet.</p>\n<h2>Trained</h2>\n<p>After years in some form of military, these adversaries&nbsp;know to maximize their effectiveness when with others&nbsp;equally trained. Unlike a regimented unit, these are&nbsp;closer to pure soldiers and do not have to be linked armand-arm to be effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Encouraging Reaction</strong>. When a trained adversary&nbsp;scores a critical hit or is killed, the next allied trained&nbsp;adversary has advantage on its next attack roll.</p>",
