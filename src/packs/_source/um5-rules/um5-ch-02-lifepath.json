Your life. until this moment. cannot be summarized with a single sentence. Two people, born from the same walks of life, can live very different lives. These following pages allow that individuality.</p>\n<p>In order to encourage unique character development, backgrounds in Ultramodern5 are presented thinly, offering little content outside of one’s primary origin, which is then used as a springboard into a customizable lifepath. You are encouraged to piece together the oftentimes random elements of a life into a story of one character. Although on the surface certain combinations may not make sense, this should encourage creativity…or the GM can simply allow you to re-roll.</p>\n<p>With Ultramodern5’s lifepath, after a player selects a background / origin, which establishes a dominant aspect of  one’s life, the lifepath continues, determining family status, siblings, friends, enemies, romantic conquests, and various other important events.</p>\n<p>With exception of Life Moments, which should be rolled, every other element can be chosen. A life built this way is still only a skeleton on which to create fleshed-out moments that integrate into the setting in question. The GM should alter these following pages, and the roll results, if they don’t mesh well in the established setting.</p>\n<p>Players are also welcome to ignore the following pages. If wishing to adhere to the standard rules regarding  backgrounds, it should be noted the ones presented here offer considerably less than those listed in official license products. The player should discuss a selection with the GM in order to make a background balanced.</p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND / ORIGIN</h2>\n<p>These following backgrounds denote where you came from, usually detailing the first few years of your life. It may not determine your current status, only that which was given to you upon your birth. You can start wealthy and lose it all or be born into poverty, only to find wealth through actions rather than luck. It should be noted that several backgrounds can be integrated together, but you can only gain the benefits of one. Avoid the instinct to select the one background most connected to your class or ladder. People change a lot through their lives, and it may be more interesting to see a rollercoaster of life-changing events rather than a straight line.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-tables.9Ae5eJKubTwXUAwS]{Lifepath Backgrounds (Rollable Table)}</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.B0jnMHWOH5zzNsip]{Background: Affluent} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.by7et1k87r6CBCJE]{Background: Bruiser} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.IGpaODHhRkwhpyC0]{Background: Delinquent}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.V1UaSrqITEfDW7o1]{Background: Disciple} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.iuoIhJSIjGtIl27x]{Background: Drifter} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.22yNL6C37pPRFrew]{Background: Intellectual}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.5rJRSPeMcfGStaXM]{Background: Laborer} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.cUlRxXBDuOtEQYFU]{Background: Recluse} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.vWzyQNR3AWzyHD35]{Background: Regular Joe}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.y2YLxUPxGFw50lHf]{Background: Smooth Talker} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-backgrounds.yv0rSahB5oOW1yz1]{Brackground: Prodigy}</p>"
