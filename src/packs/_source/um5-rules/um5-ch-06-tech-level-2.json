Electrification is now commonplace, though computers have yet to dominate civilization.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Vehicles</strong>: Ground vehicles now sport electronics; some even have climate control and electronic stability. Aircraft now have fly-by-wire, vectored thrust and vertical-take-off capacity.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Weapons</strong>: Computer tracking and targeting. Infrared and thermal imaging is available, but not standard. Firearms havenâ€™t changed but have grown more complicated with advanced reloading and higher firing rates. Advances in construction make them lighter with larger calibers.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Medical</strong>: Computer diagnostic beds, MRIs, and XRays.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Similarity</strong>: Mid 20th century to the not too distant future.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">APPLICATION OF TECH LEVELS<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The tech level can affects the difficulty and cost of the<br>crafting, repairing and modifying of technology. It can<br>also affect its rarity.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 0 and TL 1: Common. All items with no listed TL are TL0.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 2: Uncommon<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 3: Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 4: Very Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 5: Legendary</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If setting a game at a higher TL, you can shift the rarity down to make items more common. Certain items (like exo-armor) may be rarer than their listed tech level. They may also count as multiple items. Tech levels can also apply in other ways depending on the device in question: see the item descriptions for details.</span></p>",
