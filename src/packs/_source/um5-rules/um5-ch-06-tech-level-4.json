Wheeled traffic virtually nonexistent or, if it exists, can traverse any terrain. Ramjets shrink and provide massive thrust in small packages, revolutionizing transportation outside of magnetic-traffic.<br><strong>Weapons</strong>: Laser weapons “tunable.” Plasma weaponry. Bolt weapons are outdated.<br><strong>Medical</strong>: Nanotechnology can heal any wounds and even regenerate limbs.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">APPLICATION OF TECH LEVELS<br></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The tech level can affects the difficulty and cost of the<br>crafting, repairing and modifying of technology. It can<br>also affect its rarity.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 0 and TL 1: Common. All items with no listed TL are TL0.<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 2: Uncommon<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 3: Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 4: Very Rare<br></span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\">TL 5: Legendary</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If setting a game at a higher TL, you can shift the rarity down to make items more common. Certain items (like exo-armor) may be rarer than their listed tech level. They may also count as multiple items. Tech levels can also apply in other ways depending on the device in question: see the item descriptions for details.</span></p>",
