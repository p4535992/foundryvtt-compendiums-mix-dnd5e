      "value": "<p>This amulet was created by a wizard who angered a coven of night hags and needed additional protection against their magic. The Hagsbane Amulet functions as an @Compendium[dnd5e.items.50N8zf58FR4JWR05]{Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location}, but has two additional powers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once per day, when you would roll a saving throw against a spell cast by a hag, you can instead use your reaction to automatically succeed on the save.</li>\n<li>You can sense the location of any hags within 60 feet, even when they are in the ethereal plane, hidden by magic, or otherwise obscured. Using this ability, you can tell how many hags are present and their general direction relative to your location. This effect does not identify type of hag, nor does it give you the ability see see them directly, but it does make their presence known.</li>\n</ul>",
