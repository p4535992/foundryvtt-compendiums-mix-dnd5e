      "value": "<p>These long green-brown cloaks are made of bumpy leather, and carry a foul odor no matter how many times they are washed. Trollskin cloaks are still prized possessions, especially by those who are less concerned about their social standing, as they enhance the healing abilities of those who wear them.</p>\n<p>While wearing the cloak, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Â Whenever you spend a hit die to heal yourself, you gain two additional hit points per hit die you spend.</li>\n<li>Once per day, you can use an action to cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo]{Regenerate} on yourself. The spell ends when you take acid or fire damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Curse: </strong>Some versions of this item confer acid and/or fire vulnerability on the wearer at all times. This vulnerability is not revealed to the wearer until damage is taken, and from that point on, the wearer is magically compelled to remain attuned to the cloak on at all times. This effect can be removed with Remove Curse or a similar spell.</p>",
