      "value": "<p>These nondescript gloves were originally used by a traveling salesman of less-than-ethical standards. While some of his stock was legitimate, he made most of his money during public product demonstrations, which he used to trick people into thinking his products were useful and to pickpocket volunteers all in one fell swoop. His story didn't end well, but his gloves survived, and have been passed from one roguish individual to another over the years.</p>\n<p>While wearing Gloves of the Charlatan, your ability to deceive others is enhanced. Whenever you succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check, you have advantage on your next Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the same target within the next minute. The reverse is also true, so whenever you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, you have advantage on your next Charisma (Deception) check.  </p>",
