      "value": "<p>Launch a slow-moving, 4m wide sphere of dark energy in a straight line. It moves 4m at the end of each of your turns. A creature caught in the sphere's path becomes primed (necrotic) until the end of its next turn and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes necrotic damage equal to 6d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, or half as much on a successful one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the start of your turn, if the sphere has traveled 20m, it detonates and the spell ends. Each creature within a 6m radius must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes necrotic damage equal to 6d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage detonates any primed targets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can use an action to detonate the sphere before it travels 20m. If you lose concentration while casting the spell, it does not detonate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
