Until the spell ends, you AC increases by 2 but you are unable to Dodge and have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. You can use a bonus action to deactivate blade armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While blade armor is active, it is considered a melee weapon that deals 1d6 piercing damage. If a creature is grappled by you, you have advantage on attack rolls made with blade armor against the grappled creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have advantage on your Strength (Athletics) to grapple and deal 1d6 piercing damage when you grapple the target. A creature that is grappled by you while blade armor is active takes 1d6 piercing damage each time it attempts to escape from the grapple.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blade armor's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), 17th level (4d6).</p>",
