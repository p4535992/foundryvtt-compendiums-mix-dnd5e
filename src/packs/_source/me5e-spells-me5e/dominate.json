      "value": "<p>Target an organic creature within 30m. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it becomes Dominated (it is considered charmed and can't use spells or abilities). If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On its turn, the dominated creature attacks the closest creature hostile to the spell caster, making a ranged weapon attack or melee attack if it does not have a weapon. If there are no hostile creatures within range, the dominated creature uses its turn to dash towards the closest hostile creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each time the dominated creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.</p>",
