      "value": "<p>Fire a mass of supercooled, subatomic particles that explode in a 2m-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature within the sphere has its movement reduced by 4m until the start of your next turn and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saved, a creature becomes frozen until the start of your next turn. A target with shield points has advantage on this saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the blast strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 15 centimeters over an area 10m. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the blast increases by 2m for each slot level above 1st.</p>",
