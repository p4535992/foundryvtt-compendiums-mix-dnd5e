Two swarms then spread from that target to as many as two other targets, each of which must be within 6m of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the swarms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the spell ends. A creature affected by the swarm can use its action to make a Constitution check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks free of the swarm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the range the swarms can spread increases by 2m for each slot level above 1st.</p>",
