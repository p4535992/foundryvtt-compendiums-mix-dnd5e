      "value": "<p>Shoot a swarm of miniature pylons to a target location within 30m. Each creature within a 4m cylinder of the target location must make a Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in an electrified net, becoming restrained and cannot cast tech spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Until the spell ends, the area is considered difficult terrain. A creature that enters the cylinder for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there must also make the Dexterity saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature restrained by submission net may use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to escape the net. On each attempt, the creature takes 1d6 lightning damage as it struggles against the net. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the size of the net by 2m for each spell slot about the 2nd.</p>",
