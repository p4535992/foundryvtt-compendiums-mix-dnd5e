      "value": "<p>Blast a continuous stream of liquid hydrogen from your omni-tool in an 8m long by 2m wide line. Each creature in the beam must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and then becomes frozen until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frozen by this spell. Creatures with at least 1 shield point have advantage on this saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the beam's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the start of your turn, you may spend your action and 1 additional tech point to continue casting the beam. Your movement speed is 2m while casting it in this manner. The spell ends if you become incapacitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 and the length of the beam increases by 2m for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
