      "value": "<p>Your omni-tool is equipped with three microscopic, poison-tipped blades that are able to pierce through shields and armor. Make a ranged weapon attack on a creature you can see within range, expending one blade. You add your proficiency bonus to this roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus) or becomes poisoned until it finishes a short rest. All damage caused by nightshade blades bypasses shields.</p>\n<p>You must be within melee range and use an action to recover a blade, at which point you can reapply your poison and reload it into your omni-tool during a short rest. If you fail to recover your blades, you can create 3 new ones for 1 hour of work during a long rest.</p>\n<p>This feature's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), 17th level (4d12).</p>",
