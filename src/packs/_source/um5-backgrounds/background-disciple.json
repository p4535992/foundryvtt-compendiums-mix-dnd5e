Companions could have been family members or unrelated followers. Maybe you escaped a cult; maybe you are still a loyal member of a massive society. Were you raised in loving family or the victim of fanaticism? Perhaps you were given to a monastery where you learned a variety of skills from martial arts or wine making. Your opinion on faith or religion is unrelated to the selection of this background, though you would be required to select a faith, real or not.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br><strong>Skill Proficiencies</strong>: Religion or Nature<br><strong>Languages</strong>: One of your choice.<br><strong>Equipment</strong>: Holy items (if said faith endorses them) including books and symbols, a set of common clothes.</span></p>",
