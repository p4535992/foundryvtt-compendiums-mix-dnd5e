      "value": "<p>{Race} do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability to project their will onto the world. As an {race}, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p>Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that class’s spell list. In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.</p>\n<p>Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of the spell as your class permits.</p>",
