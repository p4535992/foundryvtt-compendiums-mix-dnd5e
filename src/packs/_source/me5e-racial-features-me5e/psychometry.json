If you touch an object or creature and concentrate on it for 1 minute, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object or creature's point of view, learning of any events that have occurred within 10 meters of the object or creature within the past 24 hours. If in contact with an object, you see the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long ago it was last handled. This ability may only be used once per long rest.</p>",
