      "value": "<p>You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms, meaning you can only wield weapons with the light property.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can use one of your tentacles to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can secrete a natural toxin from one of your tentacles. If a creature is grappled by the tentacle, it must succeed a DC 11 Constitution saving throw of becomes poisoned for 1 hour. The DC of this saving throw increases with your level: DC 13 at the 5th level, DC 15 at the 11th level, and DC 17 at the 17th level.</p>",
