If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.</p>\n<p>For each hour in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer one level of exhaustion. For each hour you spend outside of your suit if not in a compatible environment, suffer 3 levels of exhaustion.</p>",
