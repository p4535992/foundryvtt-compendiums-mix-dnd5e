You can switch to an undermounted weapon instantly, and it occupies the same space as the weapon it is attached to. When you purchase a weapon with the undermount property, establish if it is being purchased as a normal weapon or an undermount, and if the latter, which weapon it is being mounted to. You can only attach an undermount to a weapon one size larger (one-handed small arm &gt; two-handed small arm &gt; heavy weapon &gt; super heavy weapon). A one-handed or two-handed melee weapon counts as a one-handed small arm and a two-handed small arm respectfully.&nbsp;</span></p>",
