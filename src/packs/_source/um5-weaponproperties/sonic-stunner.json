Some variations of other sonic weapons incorporate this configuration as an adjustable switch (though they are commensurately more expensive).<br></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A target hit by a sonic stunner must make a DC20 Constitution saving throw or increase its exhaustion level by +1 (to a maximum of level 5) for 1 minute. Unlike normal exhaustion, levels incurred by this weapon reduce by 1 every minute after suffering the last attack from it.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.4w8qhwBphOalJ7Z8]{Sonic}</p>",
