It is either a weapon with a single-shot charge or it is a firearm that can only be loaded one round at a time. With an action and/or a bonus action (the character’s choice), one shot is reloaded in the weapon. Like magazine/clip-based weapons, there is a maximum number of shots you can load. If a character has additional actions in a turn, these can be used to load as well. </span></p>"
