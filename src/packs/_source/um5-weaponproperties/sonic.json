Newer sonic weapons utilize high frequency ultrasound to carry the painful audio waves in a straight, focused path. This technology offers increased range with no adverse side effects for the firer. In practical uses, the sonic weapon may&nbsp; be downgraded to transmit a normal voice across 10x its range increment to any other target without fear of anyone else overhearing unless they are inline.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Sonic weapons inflict thunder damage, and<strong> also deal additional damage to targets vulnerable to bludgeoning</strong> as if they dealt that damage type.
