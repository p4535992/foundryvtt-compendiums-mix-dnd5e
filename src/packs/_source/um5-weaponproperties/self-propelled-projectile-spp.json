Although more expensive than traditional firearms, SPPs proved useful for engagements when range mattered. The ammunition for SPP weapons are sabot rounds, as the shell ejected breaks apart, and the contained self-propelled projectile ignites, breaking from its seal. All SPP weapons can fire underwater, though their range is halved. They are not common but have definitive advantages, such as explosive warheads and guidance systems. All SPP weapons also have the @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.2YlllNRVm8tANLYy]{Guided} property.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.tHr5RIDeCFtISdMA]{Self-Propelled Projectile (SPP)}Â </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.2YlllNRVm8tANLYy]{Guided}</span></p>"
