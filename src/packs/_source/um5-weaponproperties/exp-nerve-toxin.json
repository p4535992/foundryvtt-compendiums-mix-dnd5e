By blocking nerve pulses to the muscles, the subject dies from asphyxiation or heart failure.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Nerve toxin grenades are a gas effect that only affects living creatures. After detonation, the area continues to affect any creature that starts its turn in or enters the target area for 1d4 minutes. After detonation, the nerve toxin grenade fills a 10-foot cube, expanding to 20 feet at the top of the next round and 30 feet on the round after that.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Targets are poisoned and suffer 2d6 damage each turn. At the beginning of its turn, the target can make a DC15 Constitution saving throw. It must pass two consecutive saving throws to recover from this effect.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.WklldBUUO3oesibI]{UM5 Ch.6: Granades &amp; Explosives} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.a6bTH9RIOA1gwoza]{Grenade}&nbsp; @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.tyqnHVNxWuUF1jDk]{EXP (Explosives)} @Compendium[combat-utility-belt.conditionsdnd5e.eJQ3ve6RTdjbNGEz]{Poisoned}</p>",
