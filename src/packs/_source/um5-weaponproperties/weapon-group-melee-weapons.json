Though a knife will always be standard equipment, it is more often used as a utility item rather than a weapon, at least until the pistol runs out of bullets. As expected, the concepts of laser swords and monomolecular whips are constructs of pure science fiction, and are considered neither possible nor practical for a modern military.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Size</strong>: Like firearms, melee weapons can be enlarged for Large users (exo-armor).
