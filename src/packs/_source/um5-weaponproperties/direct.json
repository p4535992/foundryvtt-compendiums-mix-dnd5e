Instead of targeting an area, this weapon can make a direct attack on a creature. Make a ranged attack: if successful, the target is automatically ground zero of the explosive attack and does not make a saving throw. It also has the potential to suffer a critical hit: otherwise, proceed with the explosive attack as normal, with the targetâ€™s position as the intended point. Additionally, if you hit the intended target with an explosive attack, roll all damage dice twice and take the higher values. Creatures in the area of effect still make a Dexterity saving throw. If you miss the intended target, the point of impact becomes a random location within a 15-foot radius of the target (which can still suffer from the area of effect blast).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #191813;\">@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.tyqnHVNxWuUF1jDk]{EXP (Explosives)}</span></p>",
