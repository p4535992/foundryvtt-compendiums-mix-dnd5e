A plasma weapon fires a toroid of superheated gas inside a magneto-hydrodynamic bubble that is then accelerated from the barrel in the same way a railgun fires its iron-core shell. The bubble remains solid for a significant time, or until it strikes its target, at which point the bubble is dispersed and delivers its energetic payload as a cloud of intense heat. There are plasma pistols, rifles, and cannons. <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Plasma weapons inflict force damage, and also deal additional damage to targets vulnerable to fire as if they dealt that damage type. Otherwise, the heat generated is too high for a creature resistant to fire to be resistant. Creatures immune to fire are only resistant to plasma weapons. If you roll a critical hit with a plasma weapon, you inflict twice the tech level in additional damage on this turn, twice the tech level -1 on the beginning of your next turn, twice tech level -2 on the beginning of the following turn, and so on until 0. <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Directed Energy</strong>: As many times a day as the weapon’s tech level, you can attempt a directed energy attack—make a single attack, firing a single shot, as an action. On a hit, roll all damage dice twice and take the higher result, add all relevant modifiers as normal, and add twice the weapon’s tech level. Each creature with-</span>  <span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">in 5 feet of the hit target also suffers damage equal to twice the weapon’s tech level. If you miss, the initial target suffers half damage with no area effect. </span></span></p>"
