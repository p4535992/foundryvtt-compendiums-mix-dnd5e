It can be cut, formed, wrapped, and combined with others of its type. Composition explosive is more expensive than standard explosive but effective in its capacity. It is also extremely stable.<br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #191813;\">With a successful DC10 @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-feats.OH5j4dwCcHTRWx9l]{Intelligence (Demolitions)} check, you can change the blast zone of the explosive from a 5-foot radius to a 10-foot cone. You must determine which area the explosive is affecting when you set it and once set and your skill check rolled, you cannot alter the explosive pattern without starting over. You cannot increase the area of a cone beyond 30 feet with additional explosives.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.WklldBUUO3oesibI]{UM5 Ch.6: Granades &amp; Explosives} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.a6bTH9RIOA1gwoza]{Grenade}&nbsp; @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.tyqnHVNxWuUF1jDk]{EXP (Explosives)}&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
