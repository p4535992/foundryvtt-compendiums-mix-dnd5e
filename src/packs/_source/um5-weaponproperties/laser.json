In history, the initial weapons concentrated radiation to a focal point, burning the target with intense heat: such&nbsp; beams were usually invisible, which is useful for stealth but less so for accuracy. Later developments increased the size, damage potential, and visibility of these beams. Often, lasers are confused with pulse plasma weapons. The largest difference is that lasers cut while plasma splashes. Laser weapons give away their firer&rsquo;s position but deliver devastating damage few can resist. They can also track targets easier with subsequent damage. There are laser pistols, rifles, and thumper cannons.<br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Laser weapons deal fire damage. If you hit with a laser, you gain a +1 bonus to your next attack roll against the same target. This is lost if you don&rsquo;t fire at the same target or if you miss. If you attack an obstruction or inanimate object, you inflict additional damage equal to twice your tech level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Goggles Do Nothing</strong>: If you roll a critical hit, the target is @Compendium[combat-utility-belt.conditionsdnd5e.oScVqOHJt5SQszVl]{Blinded} until the beginning of your next turn.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</p>",
