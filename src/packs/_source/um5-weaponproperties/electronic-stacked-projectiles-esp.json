Now they are loaded directly into the barrel, separated only by propellant. The concept dates back to traditional fireworks except the stacked projectile weapon does not need to fire its entire payload when ignited. Electrical pulses launch the bullets in the proper order. Misfires are pushed out by the next round, preventing backfire. This removes the need for a magazine, a firing pin, or for that matter, any moving parts at all. The greatest advantage of this technology is a phenomenal firing rate, capable of discharging rounds literally as a stream of bullets.<br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">ESP weapons have both the auto and auto-heavy property. You can only have one in effect at a time, and can switch between them as a bonus action.Â </span></p>"
