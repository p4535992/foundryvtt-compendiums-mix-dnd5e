The grenade doesn't explode but rather opens valves, releasing compressed tear gas. In addition to creating an obscuring field of smoke, the gas causes skin and eye irritation on contact, throat and nose irritation if inhaled.<br></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Riot grenades are a gas effect that only affects living creatures. After detonation, the area continues to affect any creature that starts its turn in or enters the target area for 1d4 minutes. After detonation, the riot grenade fills a 10-foot cube, expanding to 20 feet at the top of the next round and 30 feet on the round after that. Targets are poisoned and their speed is halved. At the beginning of its turn, the target can make a DC15 Constitution saving throw. It must pass 2 consecutive saving throws to recover from this effect.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-rules.WklldBUUO3oesibI]{UM5 Ch.6: Granades &amp; Explosives} @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.a6bTH9RIOA1gwoza]{Grenade}&nbsp; @Compendium[compendiums-mix-dnd5e.um5-weaponproperties.tyqnHVNxWuUF1jDk]{EXP (Explosives)}&nbsp;@Compendium[combat-utility-belt.conditionsdnd5e.eJQ3ve6RTdjbNGEz]{Poisoned}</p>",
