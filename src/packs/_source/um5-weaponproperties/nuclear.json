Where a laser inflicts condensed radiation and plasma inflicts severe heat, weapons with the nuclear property inflict damage via a high-energy beam of atoms. Upon impact, they disrupt the molecular structure of the target. Tissue damage from radiation is an often side effect. This technology has been dubbed a \"dirty solution\", as it emerges frequently before the advancement of high-powered lasers and plasma weapons. In other circles, these devices have been called particle accelerators.<br style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\" /></span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Nuclear weapons inflict force damage, and also deal additional damage to creatures vulnerable to necrotic as if they dealt that damage type. If you hit with a nuclear weapon, every subsequent hit on the same target gains a +1 bonus to damage. This is cumulative up to the weapon’s tech level and is lost if you don’t hit that same target before the end of your next turn. If you roll a critical hit, the target is @Compendium[combat-utility-belt.conditionsdnd5e.eJQ3ve6RTdjbNGEz]{Poisoned} until the beginning of your next turn.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\"> </p>"
