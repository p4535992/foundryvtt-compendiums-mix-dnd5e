No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm.<br>The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, etc.) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm.

You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn’t affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"ability":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"formula":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}}}
