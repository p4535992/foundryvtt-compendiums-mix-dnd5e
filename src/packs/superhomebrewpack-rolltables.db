The demon is a replica of your character. They have the same spells, traits, hit points, armor class, levels, and abilities as you. You have to defeat them in the dream. If you lose, the demon will take over your body until someone casts @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} on you. If you win, you get as much experience as if slaying a monster of a CR equal to your level (i.e. if you are level 8, you gain the experience of killing a CR 8 monster) and, as a bonus action, you can summon the demonic replica once per <i>Long Rest</i> at a point within 60 feet of you to do your bidding. The demonic replica lasts for 1 round, and then disappears.","img":"modules/compendiums-mix-dnd5e/assets/supershomebrewpack/icons/deck_of_many_things/comet.png","weight":1,"range":[2,2],"drawn":false,"documentId":null,"documentCollection":""},{"_id":"5UIvk9oV9SnURqHV","flags":{},"type":0,"text":"<h2>Euryale</h2>The card's medusa-like visage curses you.
